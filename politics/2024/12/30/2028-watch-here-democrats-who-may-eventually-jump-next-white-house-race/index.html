    <p>As Democrats aim to rebound following stunning setbacks in the 2024 elections, the race for Democratic National Committee chair is very publicly heating up.</p><p>Getting less attention, but also starting to quietly commence, are moves by Democratic politicians who may have national ambitions in the next White House race.</p><p>And while 2028 may seem like a long way away, recent history shows that the early moves in the next White House race start, well, very early.</p><p>The unofficial starting gun for the 2024 race was fired by then-former President Donald Trump less than two months after leaving the White House, with a CPAC speech that teased his eventual 2024 presidential campaign.</p><p>A few weeks later, the first visits to the key early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire by potential GOP presidential contenders were also underway.</p><p>Fast-forward four years, and expect similar actions by Democratic politicians who may harbor national ambitions. With the soon-to-be 82-year-old President Biden exiting the national stage, and Vice President Kamala Harris, in the wake of her defeat by Trump, in no immediate rush to decide her political future, the road to the 2028 nomination may be wide open.</p><p>"The jockeying for 2028 took a brief pause when Harris became the nominee and looked to be in a strong position, which would have meant shutting out potential candidates for the next four to eight years. Now, though, it’s wide open, and it won’t be long before we see clear maneuvering from a litany of candidates," seasoned Democratic political strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News.</p><p>Moyer, a veteran of a handful of presidential campaigns, noted that "this will include travel to states like New Hampshire and South Carolina and Nevada, presumably under the auspices of helping candidates in the midterms. Democratic voters in the early states will soon want to find someone they can get excited about and a future to look forward to in the midst of the misery of another four years of Trump in the White House. These potential candidates will be more than happy to oblige."</p><p>The results of the 2026 midterm elections will have a major impact on the shape of the next White House race.</p><p>For now, however, here is an initial look at Democratic Party politicians considered to be potential 2028 presidential contenders.</p><p>As the 60-year-old Harris finishes up her final weeks as the nation's vice president, early polling in the 2028 Democratic nomination race indicates that she would be a front-runner, thanks in part to her name recognition within her party.</p><p>While any decisions on her next political steps are months away, sources in the vice president's orbit confirm to Fox News that top aides are divided on whether Harris should run again for the White House in 2028, or instead launch a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in her home state of California, which would likely prevent her from seeking the presidency two years later.</p><p>While there are plenty of voices within the party who would like to move on from the Biden/Harris era following Trump's sweeping victory, and there is little history of Democrats yearning for past defeated presidential nominees, Trump has re-written the rules when it comes to defeated White House contenders making another run. </p><p>And potential buyers' remorse of a second Trump administration could boost Harris in the years to come.</p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom was a top surrogate for President Biden during the president's re-election bid. With the blessing of the White House, the two-term California governor debated then-Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last year on Fox News. </p><p>Newsom's travels on behalf of Biden brought him to New Hampshire and South Carolina, two crucial early voting states on the Democratic Party's nominating calendar.</p><p>After the vice president, his friend and fellow Californian, replaced Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, the governor continued — after a pause — his efforts to keep Trump from returning to the White House.</p><p>With Trump's election victory last week, Newsom became one of the Democratic Party leaders getting ready to lead the opposition. The governor announced that California state lawmakers would meet to quickly take legislative action to counter Trump's likely upcoming agenda.</p><p>The 57-year-old Newsom's second term in Sacramento will finish at the end of next year, right around the time the 2028 presidential election will start to heat up.</p><p>Illinois Gov JB Pritzker, similar to Newsom, is already taking steps to Trump-proof his state.</p><p>"You come for my people, you come through me," Pritzker told reporters of his efforts to protect Illinois.</p><p>Pritzker was also a high-profile surrogate on behalf of Biden and then Harris during the 2024 cycle. Those efforts brought Pritzker to Nevada, a general election battleground state and an early-voting Democratic presidential primary state, and New Hampshire.</p><p>However, before he makes any decision about 2028, the 59-year-old governor must decide whether he will run in 2026 for a third term steering Illinois.</p><p>Two-term Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer grabbed plenty of attention and became a Democratic Party rising star in 2020 when she feuded with then-President Trump over COVID pandemic federal assistance and survived a foiled kidnapping attempt.</p><p>Trump, at the time, called her "that woman from Michigan."</p><p>Along with Newsom and Pritzker, Whitmer's name was floated as a possible replacement for Biden following his disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June, before the president endorsed Harris and the party instantly coalesced around the vice president.</p><p>Whitmer was a leading surrogate for Biden and then for Harris and made a big impression on Democratic activists during a stop this summer in New Hampshire on behalf of Harris.</p><p>The governor is term-limited and will leave office after the end of next year.</p><p>Gov. Josh Shapiro, the 51-year-old first-term governor of Pennsylvania, was on Harris' short-list for vice presidential nominee.</p><p>Even though the vice president named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Shapiro remained a top surrogate on behalf of his party's 2024 national ticket. </p><p>However, his two-day swing in New Hampshire during the final full week ahead of Election Day did raise some eyebrows and 2028 speculation.</p><p>After Harris lost battleground Pennsylvania to Trump, there was plenty of talk within the party that Harris had made the wrong choice for her running mate.</p><p>Shapiro, who has a track record of taking on the first Trump administration as Pennsylvania attorney general, is expected to play a similar role with the former president returning to the White House.</p><p>The governor will be up for re-election in 2026.</p><p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is considered by many to be another Democratic Party rising star.</p><p>The 46-year-old Army veteran, Rhodes Scholar and CEO of the charitable organization the Robin Hood Foundation during the coronavirus pandemic was elected two years ago.</p><p>Moore will be up for re-election in 2026.</p><p>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who surpassed expectations during his 2020 Democratic presidential nomination run, was a very active surrogate on behalf of Biden and later Harris, during the 2024 cycle.</p><p>He helped raise a lot of money for the Democratic Party ticket, including heading a top-dollar fundraiser in New Hampshire.</p><p>The 42-year-old former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and former naval officer who served in the war in Afghanistan, is considered one of the party's biggest and brightest stars. He was known as a top communicator for the administration, including making frequent appearances on Fox News.</p><p>The 46-year-old Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who was elected governor in 2019 and then re-elected in 2023 in red-state Kentucky, was also on Harris' larger list for running mate.</p><p>Beshear made plenty of new friends and contacts as he ventured to New Hampshire last month to headline the state Democratic Party's annual fall fundraising gala.</p><p>Beshear served as Kentucky's attorney general before running for governor.</p><p>Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, 55, will likely be a major player in Washington as the Democratic minority in the Senate fights back against the second Trump administration.</p><p>Warnock, who won Senate elections in 2020 and 2022 in battleground Georgia, served as senior pastor at the famed Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.</p><p>He is up for re-election in the Senate in 2028.</p><p>New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is considered one of the party's most talented orators.</p><p>Thanks to his 2020 run, Booker made plenty of friends and allies in such early states as New Hampshire and South Carolina.</p><p>The senator is up for re-election in 2026.</p><p>Since the November election, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been very vocal about the steps Democrats need to make to win back working-class voters.</p><p>First elected to the House in 2006 and to the Senate in 2012, Murphy cruised to re-election this year by nearly 20 points, which means he won't have to decide between a re-election bid and a White House run in 2028.</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna, 48, was a tireless surrogate on behalf of Biden and then Harris. </p><p>He has been a regular visitor to New Hampshire in the past couple of years, including a high-profile debate last year against then-GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.</p><p>The progressive rock star and best-known lawmaker among the so-called Squad of diverse House Democrats in October turned 35, the minimum age to run for president.</p><p>Some Democrats argue that a riveting messenger with star power is needed as the party's next nominee, and Ocasio-Cortez is guaranteed to grab plenty of attention if she ultimately decides to run.</p><p>Another potential contender with plenty of star power is Mark Cuban.</p><p>The billionaire business mogul and part-owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks’ was a high-profile surrogate for Harris during her presidential election campaign.</p><p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, 67, who is finishing up his eighth and final year as governor, took his name out of the Harris running mate speculation early in the process this summer.</p><p>Cooper served 16 years as North Carolina's attorney general before winning election as governor.</p><p>New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, 65, is halfway through her second term steering New Mexico.</p><p>The governor, a former member of Congress, was a high-profile and busy surrogate on behalf of Harris during the final weeks of the 2024 campaign.</p><p>The 60-year-old Minnesota governor, who served as Harris' running mate, has two years remaining in his second term in office.</p><p>While the vice presidential nominee's energy and enthusiasm on the campaign trail this year impressed plenty of Democratic strategists, the final results of the election will make any potential future national run for Walz difficult.</p><p>Two other names keep coming up — <strong>Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey</strong> and former Chicago mayor, former congressman, former White House chief of staff and current <strong>ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel.</strong></p>
