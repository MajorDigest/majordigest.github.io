    <p>Donald Trump, who overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, was sworn in Monday as the 47th U.S. president, taking charge as Republicans claim unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the country’s institutions.</p><p>Trump’s swearing-in ceremony moved indoors due to intense cold. Festivities started earlier when Trump arrived for service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. Then, he and his wife, Melania, were welcomed by President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, where they shared tea and coffee at the White House.</p><div class="customHtml"></div><p>Here&#x27;s the latest:</p><h3 id="h2_no_longer_president%2C_biden_leaves_capitol">No longer president, Biden leaves Capitol</h3><p>He and his wife, Jill, boarded a military helicopter on the grounds of the Capitol after Trump was sworn into office.</p><p>Biden is going to Joint Base Andrews for a farewell ceremony with now-former members of his staff.</p><p>He’ll then fly aboard a military airplane to Santa Ynez, California, to unwind with his family.</p><div class="apm-gallery"><div class="apm-gallery_title"> </div><div class="apm-gallery_slides"><div id="slideshow" data-testid="slideshow" class="slideshow"><button aria-haspopup="dialog" data-testid="fullscreen-button" class="slideshow_fullscreen"><svg class="icon icon-fullscreen slideshow_icon slideshow_icon-fullscreen" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M6.987 10.987l-2.931 3.031-2.056-2.429v6.411h6.387l-2.43-2.081 3.030-2.932-2-2zM11.613 2l2.43 2.081-3.030 2.932 2 2 2.931-3.031 2.056 2.429v-6.411h-6.387z"></path></svg><span class="invisible" data-testid="icon-fullscreen">Fullscreen Slideshow</span></button><button data-testid="prev-button" aria-label="Icon Chevron Left" class="slideshow_button slideshow_button-prev"><svg class="icon icon-chevronLeft slideshow_icon" width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M48.2 47.4L30 47.4C28.9 47.4 28 46.5 28 45.4L28 44.3C28 43.2 28.9 42.3 30 42.3L46.2 42.3 46.2 26.1C46.2 25 47.1 24.1 48.2 24.1L49.4 24.1C50.5 24.1 51.4 25 51.4 26.1L51.4 45.4C51.4 46.5 50.5 47.4 49.4 47.4L48.2 47.4Z" fill="#FFFFFF" transform="translate(21, 18) rotate(135) translate(-39.7, -35.8)"></path></g></svg><span class="invisible">Previous Slide</span></button><div class="slideshow_container" aria-modal="false" aria-label="Slideshow container"><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">20 of 20</div></div></div><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">1 of 20</div></div></div><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">2 of 20</div></div></div></div><button data-testid="next-button" aria-label="Icon Chevron Right" class="slideshow_button slideshow_button-next"><svg class="icon icon-chevronRight slideshow_icon" width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M39.2 47.4L21 47.4C19.9 47.4 19 46.5 19 45.4L19 44.3C19 43.2 19.9 42.3 21 42.3L37.2 42.3 37.2 26.1C37.2 25 38.1 24.1 39.2 24.1L40.4 24.1C41.5 24.1 42.4 25 42.4 26.1L42.4 45.4C42.4 46.5 41.5 47.4 40.4 47.4L39.2 47.4Z" fill="#FFFFFF" transform="translate(12, 18) rotate(-45) translate(-30.7, -35.8) "></path></g></svg><span class="invisible">Next Slide</span></button><div id="slideshowBg" role="figure" data-testid="slideshowBg" class="slideshow_bg"></div></div></div></div><h3 id="h2_leaders_of_israel%2C_egypt_congratulate_trump_on_his_inauguration">Leaders of Israel, Egypt congratulate Trump on his inauguration</h3><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi were among those wishing Trump well in his new term in the White House.</p><p>Netanyahu predicted “the best days of our alliance are yet to come,” even as he hailed actions Trump took in his first term, including moving the American embassy to Jerusalem.</p><p>El-Sissi said he’d work with Trump to enhance their countries’ relationship.</p><p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose Labor government has been under attack by Elon Musk and other Trump allies, also sent his “warmest congratulations.”</p><h3 id="h2_trump_and_vance_have_departed">Trump and Vance have departed</h3><p>President Trump, VP Vance, and the first and Second Lady have departed.</p><p>Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris have also left.</p><p>The Trump family is waiting for the remaining former presidents to leave the platform before they are escorted out</p><h3 id="h2_trump_has_left_the_capitol_rotunda">Trump has left the Capitol Rotunda</h3><p>He is next expected to appear at a signing room ceremony.</p><h3 id="h2_macchio_returns_for_%E2%80%9Cthe_star-spangled_banner%E2%80%9D">Macchio returns for “The Star-Spangled Banner”</h3><p>Trump selected opera tenor Christopher Macchio to perform the national anthem during the inauguration. He’s a smaller name than some of the performers who’ve offered their renditions of “The Star-Spangled Banner” in the past.</p><p>In 2021, Lady Gaga sang the national anthem for President Joe Biden. In 2013, Beyoncé performed the national anthem and later said she had lip-synced to a taped track for President Barack Obama.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_again_will_withdraw_the_us_from_paris_climate_agreement">Trump again will withdraw the US from Paris Climate Agreement</h3><p>Trump says he will again withdraw the United States, a top carbon-polluting nation, from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, dealing a blow to worldwide efforts to combat global warming and once again distancing the U.S. from its closest allies.</p><p>The announcement echoed Trump’s actions in 2017 when he announced that the U.S. would abandon the Paris accord, which is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The 2015 Paris Agreement is voluntary and allows nations to provide targets to cut their own emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_repeated_his_desire_to_take_back_the_panama_canal">Trump repeated his desire to take back the Panama Canal</h3><p>Trump did not express intentions to take back the Panama Canal during his campaign but began talking about wanting this vital waterway last month. During his inaugural address, Trump said the spirit of a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter that relinquished control of the canal in 1999 had been violated.</p><p>He said the waterway should have never been given away and said that “American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly,” and repeated that “China is operating the Panama Canal.” Earlier this month, he said he would not rule out military force to take control of it.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_ends_cbp_one%2C_a_biden-era_border_app_that_gave_legal_entry_to_nearly_1_million_migrants_with_online_appointments">Trump ends CBP One, a Biden-era border app that gave legal entry to nearly 1 million migrants with online appointments</h3><h3 id="h2_religious_leaders_offer_benedictions">Religious leaders offer benedictions</h3><p>Rabbi Ari Berman delivered the first of several benedictions after Trump delivered his inaugural address. Berman is president of Yeshiva University, a Jewish institution in Manhattan. He is the second Orthodox rabbi to deliver the benediction at a presidential inauguration.</p><p>At least one prayer has been recited by clergy members at presidential inaugurals since 1937 during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s second inauguration.</p><p>Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, pastor of 180 Church Detroit, followed during the second of the benediction, saying, “Heavenly father we are so grateful that you gave our 45th and now our 47th president a millimeter miracle.”</p><h3 id="h2_advocacy_groups_greet_trump%E2%80%99s_swearing-in_with_a_lawsuit_over_doge">Advocacy groups greet Trump’s swearing-in with a lawsuit over DOGE</h3><p>A coalition of veterans, public health professionals, teachers, consumer advocates and watchdog groups has filed a legal challenge in federal court against Trump’s special commission on promoting government efficiency.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed just after Trump’s swearing-in. It seeks an injunction against the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p><p>The suit charges that Trump is operating the group without complying with federal transparency laws, and argues that the activities of private commissions must be made public.</p><p>Trump mentioned DOGE, which is being headed by billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in his inauguration speech.</p><h3 id="h2_today%E2%80%99s_speech_was_a_sharp_departure_from_%E2%80%98american_carnage%E2%80%99">Today’s speech was a sharp departure from ‘American carnage’</h3><p>Trump’s second inaugural speech marked a major departure from his tone the first time he took the Oath of Office.</p><p>Back in 2017, Trump delivered an inaugural address that put aside the typical optimism and promises of unity with a dark portrait of national life as he spoke of “American Carnage.”</p><p>“From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America first,” he had declared then.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_concludes_his_speech">Trump concludes his speech</h3><p>Trump finished speaking after about 30 minutes.</p><p>It was a very short speech by Trump’s standards.</p><p>His 2024 campaign rally speeches often went on for more than an hour.</p><h3 id="h2_photos_of_the_swearing-in_show_trump_with_his_hand_at_his_side%2C_not_atop_the_bible._does_it_matter%3F">Photos of the swearing-in show Trump with his hand at his side, not atop the Bible. Does it matter?</h3><p>It’s traditional to use a Bible during the presidential oath of office, but it is not required. Only the oath is mandated by the Constitution.</p><p>Theodore Roosevelt didn’t use a Bible when he was sworn in following the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. John Quincy Adams used a law text for his 1825 inauguration.</p><p>And, sworn in aboard Air Force One after John Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Lyndon B. Johnson used a Catholic missal.</p><h3 id="h2_who_wants_to_go_to_mars%3F">Who wants to go to Mars?</h3><p>Trump’s enthusiasm for sending astronauts to Mars was shared by some — but not all — Americans in a 2019 AP-NORC poll.</p><p>About 3 in 10 US adults said that sending astronauts to Mars was “very” or “extremely” important, about one-third said it was “moderately” important, and about 4 in 10 said it was “not too” or “not at all” important.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_appears_to_be_concluding_on_a_positive_note">Trump appears to be concluding on a positive note</h3><p>“Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback, but as you see here today, here I am,” he said.</p><p>“I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do in America,” he went on, adding: “In America, the impossible is what we do best.</p><h3 id="h2_inauguration_performer_carrie_underwood_doesn%E2%80%99t_usually_get_involved_with_politics">Inauguration performer Carrie Underwood doesn’t usually get involved with politics</h3><p>Country music star Carrie Underwood is performing “America the Beautiful” at today’s inauguration.</p><p>“I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” Underwood said in a statement shortly after the news broke. “I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”</p><p>But Underwood has avoided discussing politics across her career, in 2019 telling The Guardian, “I feel like more people try to pin me places politically. I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It’s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it’s black and white. And it’s not like that.”</p><h3 id="h2_trump_wants_to_plant_an_american_flag_on_mars">Trump wants to plant an American flag on Mars</h3><p>Trump says he wants to send American astronauts to Mars, saying he “will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars” and “plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars.”</p><p>Billionaire Elon Musk of SpaceX threw his hands up in the air as Trump announced the U.S. would plant its flag on Mars.</p><h3 id="h2_trump%E2%80%99s_plans_for_reshaping_american_asylum">Trump’s plans for reshaping American asylum</h3><p>Trump said “all illegal entry will immediately be halted,” with few details on how he will achieve that. He said he would end the practice of releasing migrants in the United States to pursue asylum, known as “catch-and-release,” but didn’t say how he would pay for the enormous costs of detention.</p><p>Part of his plan relies on resuming the “Remain in Mexico” policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court, a hallmark of his first term. The Mexican government has agreed, signaling perhaps one of the most concrete and immediate changes that will be seen at the border.</p><p>Trump said little about his plans for mass deportation, saying only that he would deport “millions and millions of criminal aliens.”</p><h3 id="h2_there_is_more_than_1_split-screen_in_washington_on_monday">There is more than 1 split-screen in Washington on Monday</h3><p>The Rev. Al Sharpton and other Black leaders led a standing-room-only congregation in a passionate and political Martin Luther King Jr. Day as Trump was being sworn in.</p><p>The timing was no accident.</p><p>“We want people to see the tale of two cities in one,” Sharpton cried, as Trump was being inaugurated at the Capitol.</p><p>Sharpton introduced Korey Wise — one of the falsely accused Central Park Five Black defendants whose execution Trump had lobbied for — to cheers from the crowd, and rattled off a series of actions he said Trump had taken against Black Americans and civil rights.</p><p>“We will fight the next four years no matter what he says,” Sharpton said.</p><p>“Everything that Dr. King stood for is at risk with this president, this Congress,” Sharpton said.</p><h3 id="h2_not-so-record_inflation">Not-so-record inflation</h3><p>Trump vowed to “defeat what was record inflation.”</p><p>Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 after rising steadily in the first 17 months of Biden’s presidency from a low of 0.1% in May 2020. The most recent data shows that as of December it had fallen to 2.9%.</p><p>But other historical periods have seen higher inflation, such as a more than 14% rate in 1980, according to the Federal Reserve.</p><h3 id="h2_trump%E2%80%99s_promised_day_1_executive_orders">Trump’s promised Day 1 executive orders</h3><p>Here are a few of the executive orders Trump says he plans to issue on his first day:</p><p>1. Several on immigration, including declaring a national emergency at southern border, reinstating the “remain in Mexico” policy and sending troops to the southern border.</p><p>2. Seeking a broad government effort to reduce inflation and reduce prices.</p><p>3. Declaring a “national energy emergency” and allowing for more energy production.</p><p>4. Ending what he has called an “electric vehicle mandate.”</p><h3 id="h2_trump_repeats_unfounded_immigration_claim_at_the_crux_of_his_campaign">Trump repeats unfounded immigration claim at the crux of his campaign</h3><p>In his inaugural address, Trump repeated a line he usually brought up during his campaign, saying that immigrants arriving in the country illegally come from prisons and mental institutions.</p><p>There is no evidence countries are sending their criminals or mentally ill across the border.</p><h3 id="h2_trump%E2%80%99s_inauguration_address_echoes_his_rally_speeches">Trump’s inauguration address echoes his rally speeches</h3><p>The speech Trump is delivering sounds a lot like his rally speeches, with plenty of grievance, including references to those who tried to “take my freedom” and the “weaponization of our Justice Department.”</p><p>Trump, after leaving office, became the first former president to be indicted, convicted and sentenced. But he has long tried to cast his many investigations as politically motivated.</p><h3 id="h2_some_democrats_join_standing_ovation_over_border_emergency">Some Democrats join standing ovation over border emergency</h3><p>Trump is laying out his executive orders, starting with declaring a state of emergency on the southern border, which received a standing ovation from all Republicans and a few swing state Democrats, including Reps. Don Davis and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_wants_to_make_martin_luther_king_jr.%E2%80%98s_dream_%E2%80%98a_reality%E2%80%99">Trump wants to make Martin Luther King Jr.‘s dream ‘a reality’</h3><p>Trump marked the fact that his inauguration is occurring on Martin Luther King Jr. Day., saying in his speech that his administration will “strive together to make his dream a reality.”</p><p>“We will make his dream come true,” Trump vowed of the Rev.

That’s because Lincoln’s family Bible was still packed and on its way to Washington from Springfield, Illinois, along with the Lincoln family’s other belongings.</p><p>In 2017, Trump stacked a family Bible atop Lincoln’s while taking the oath. He’s set to do the same with his own Bible and Lincoln’s this time.</p><p>That recalls Barack Obama, who also used the Lincoln Bible during his first swearing-in in 2009.

Johnson used a Catholic missal.</p><p>Also, who holds the Bible during the inaugural ceremony isn’t spelled out. Lady Bird Johnson set a tradition that has continued until today when she became the first incoming-first lady to hold the Bible for her husband Lyndon’s second inauguration in January 1965.</p><p>Prior to that, the Bibles were often held by an unknown official — people not easily identified in historical photographs.</p><h3 id="h2_biden%E2%80%99s_other_family_pardon_proved_unpopular">Biden’s other family pardon proved unpopular</h3><p>Only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of Biden’s previous decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, according to an AP-NORC poll from December — suggesting that his last-minute move to issue pardons to his family members may not be received well.</p><p>That poll found that about 4 in 10 Democrats approved of the pardon, while about 3 in 10 disapproved and about one-quarter did not have an opinion or did not know enough to say.

President Trump is for you.”</p><p>Civil rights groups were preparing to challenge Trump’s restrictions in court before he took office.</p><p>“We are going to persevere, we’re going to continue in our work and we’re going to continue to protect trans rights throughout the country,” said Ash Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality last week, anticipating such an order.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_to_issue_orders_on_immigration%2C_ap_source_says">Trump to issue orders on immigration, AP source says</h3><p>Trump is going to issue a series of orders aimed at remaking America’s immigration policies on his first day in office Monday — ending asylum access, sending troops to the southern border and ending birthright citizenship, an incoming White House official said.</p><p>It’s unclear how he would carry out some of his executive orders, including ending automatic citizenship for everyone born in the country, while others were expected to be immediately challenged in the courts.</p><p>The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to preview some of the orders expected later Monday.</p><p>Immigrant communities were bracing for the crackdown that Trump had been promising throughout his campaign and up through a rally Sunday just ahead of his inauguration.</p><h3 id="h2_the_service_concludes_with_congregants_singing_%E2%80%98america_the_beautiful%E2%80%99">The service concludes with congregants singing ‘America the Beautiful’</h3><p>The Trumps held hands as they filed out of the church and the president-elect nodded and offered smiles to the churchgoers as he exited the sanctuary.</p><h3 id="h2_best_seats_in_the_house">Best seats in the house</h3><p>Hours before Trump and Vance are expected to be inaugurated, seats designated for Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and others were among the closest to the platform where Trump will be taking the oath of office.</p><p>Even Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, had a better seat than the majority of House and Senate lawmakers.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_tells_supporters_to_%E2%80%98never_ever%2C_ever_give_up%E2%80%99_in_new_video">Trump tells supporters to ‘never ever, ever give up’ in new video</h3><p>Trump’s team released the video online on Monday ahead of his swearing-in and it portrays him as an outsider who overcame his legal problems to win a comeback to the White House, ushering in a new chapter for America.</p><p>The video stitches together footage of his courthouse appearances for his criminal trial last year, his mug shot from another criminal case in Georgia and images of prosecutors and judges involved in some of the other cases he faced, along with images of his visits to UFC matches, his campaign and the Republican National Convention.</p><p>In a voice-over, Trump tells his supporters they have to “never ever, ever give up” and “treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation.”</p><p>The video was first reported by Fox News Digital.</p><h3 id="h2_white_house_press_offices_emptying_out">White House press offices emptying out</h3><p>Cupboards and drawers have been emptied, the walls are bare and all personal items have been boxed up, including in press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre’s office.</p><p>Most of the press office staff wrapped up their government service last week.</p><p>A couple of press secretaries and assistants remain to see Biden through tea with Trump, the ride to the Capitol for the inauguration and Biden’s departure ceremony afterward.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_enters_church_for_service_ahead_of_inauguration">Trump enters church for service ahead of inauguration</h3><p>President-elect Donald Trump has entered St. John’s Episcopal Church with his wife, Melania, for a service ahead of the inauguration, taking part in a long presidential tradition.</p><p>The Trumps spent the night at Blair House and will head to the White House for a coffee and tea with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden following the service.</p><h3 id="h2_us_flag_atop_white_house_flying_at_half-staff">US flag atop White House flying at half-staff</h3><p>Biden had ordered that flags at federal facilities be lowered for 30 days out of respect for Jimmy Carter. The former president died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100.</p><p>Many governors also lowered the flag on state buildings.</p><p>But Trump complained that flags at the U.S. Capitol would fly at half-staff when he takes the oath of office to begin his second term.</p><p>Many Republican governors since have said the flag will be raised for the inauguration and lowered again afterward to respect Carter.</p><p>The White House had said Biden would not consider reversing or reevaluating the flag order.</p><h3 id="h2_guests_arrive_at_st._john%E2%80%99s_episcopal_church_for_inauguration_day_service">Guests arrive at St. John’s Episcopal Church for Inauguration Day service</h3><p>Elon Musk and several of President-elect Trump’s Cabinet picks are already in the pews awaiting his arrival and the start of the service at the historic church on Lafayette Square.</p><p>Among the other guests are Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio, Argentina President Javier Milei and the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump</p><h3 id="h2_audiences_take_their_seats_at_capitol_one_arena">Audiences take their seats at Capitol One arena</h3><p>Long lines stretched around the icy sidewalks and security perimeters of Capitol One Arena where ticket holders hoped to be among the 20,000 to get in.</p><p>Inside the arena before 8:30 a.m. the atmosphere was calm — the seats largely empty as workers finalized preparations and the media set up cameras and lights on the arena floor.</p><p>Security and inauguration staff scolded members of the press inside for stray equipment in the hallways, saying doors would be held for the general public until it was cleared. Around 8:25 a.m., the public started to take their seats as the Katrina and the Waves song “Walking on Sunshine” blared on the speakers.</p><h3 id="h2_%E2%80%98we_don%E2%80%99t_have_to_stand_out_here_on_the_lawn_to_show_our_support%E2%80%99">‘We don’t have to stand out here on the lawn to show our support’</h3><p>Pam Pollard, a former National Committeewoman from Oklahoma City, arrived in Washington nearly a week ago and said she was in line to sit in a reserved section at the inauguration before it was moved inside.</p><p>She agreed with the change because people could get so caught up in the moment that they might endanger themselves.</p><p>Pollard, 65, who was at the state convention and the Republican National Convention that formally nominated Trump to be the party’s candidate, suggested people break up into watch parties.</p><p>“We all believe God’s hand has been on this man to be elected,” she said. “We don’t have to stand out here on the lawn to show our support, our unity.”</p><h3 id="h2_german_chancellor_stresses_the_importance_of_trans-atlantic_relations">German chancellor stresses the importance of trans-Atlantic relations</h3><p>“Trans-Atlantic relations are of the utmost importance for Germany and for Europe,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Rheinische Post. “And NATO is the guarantor of our security. That is why we need stable relations with the USA.”</p><p>Scholz’s comments came hours before Trump’s inauguration.</p><p>The German chancellor also said that “as the European Union, we can also build on our own strength. As a community of more than 400 million Europeans, we have economic weight.”</p><p>He said he had already talked to Trump on the phone twice without elaborating when the calls took place.</p><h3 id="h2_foreign_leaders_descend_upon_washington_for_inauguration_day">Foreign leaders descend upon Washington for Inauguration Day</h3><p>Trump may be breaking a tradition on Inauguration Day. No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration.</p><p>It’s not clear whether foreign leaders will attend the swearing-in ceremony or other events related such as inaugural balls.</p><p>Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Italy’s Premier Giorgia Meloni have spoken about being invited. The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Peña have also said they were invited and were planning to attend. The Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. said there had been an invitation to the country’s President Nayib Bukele, but he is not likely to attend.</p><p>Last month, Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, had been invited. Jinping is unlikely to attend and it’s not clear whether he would send another official.</p><h3 id="h2_moving_day_madness">Moving day madness</h3><p>The “transfer of families” is a frenetic Inauguration Day ritual of approximately five hours where the White House is turned over from the outgoing presidential family to the incoming one.</p><p>In that time, while the outgoing and incoming presidents are together for the inaugural ceremony — White House residence staff hustle to inventory belongings, pack and move out one family and prepare the residence for its new occupants.</p><p>The process wasn’t always so efficient, though.</p><p>After the disputed election of 1876, outgoing President Ulysses S. Grant suggested that his successor, Rutherford B. Hayes, take the oath of office two days early to prevent potential unrest.</p><p>Hayes did that but then took a second oath as scheduled. Grant, though, didn’t actually vacate the White House until after Haye’s second swearing-in.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_will_get_ahold_of_an_old_x_account">Trump will get ahold of an old X account</h3><p>The White House’s official X account, and its 37 million followers, will shift around midday from Joe Biden to Donald Trump.</p><p>The process is similar to Inauguration Day 2017 when the @POTUS account — created during Barack Obama’s tenure — was transferred to Trump’s first administration.</p><p>The same will be true for @WhiteHouse, the first lady’s @FLOTUS and @VP for the vice president.</p><p>Twitter suspended Trump’s personal account, @realDonaldTrump, in 2021, after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>But Trump supporter Elon Musk later bought Twitter, renaming it X, and Trump rejoined the platform last summer — though he uses his Truth Social network more.</p><h3 id="h2_inauguration_day_has_moved_around_the_calendar_%E2%80%94_and_the_country">Inauguration Day has moved around the calendar — and the country</h3><p>Congress directed in September 1788 that the presidential swearing-in ceremony occur on the first Wednesday in March. But George Washington wasn’t actually inaugurated until April 30, 1789, on the balcony of Federal Hall in New York City, then the nation’s capital.</p><p>The capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790 before construction was completed on the White House in 1800. There, Washington was sworn in for his second term in,1793, and John Adams was inaugurated in 1797.</p><p>Most inaugurations took place on March 4 until the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which set the ceremony for noon on Jan. 20.</p><p>Where inaugurations took place also traditionally varied. But they’ve been held on the Capitol’s western front, facing the National Mall, since Ronald Reagan took office in January 1981.</p><h3 id="h2_how_performing_at_the_inauguration_could_impact_musicians">How performing at the inauguration could impact musicians</h3><p>“The people who are coming out and participating directly are still a small subset of the entire universe of what we call celebrity,” said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. “But we’re seeing a lot more celebrities who are coming out and supporting Trump. There may not be that distinct division that we saw before.”</p><p>There may still be a tinge of stigma, however. Thompson pointed to the statement from The Village People, in which they offered a justification their involvement, which he likened to an apologia.</p><p>Also, Thompson said, “The idea of being featured in a big national civic ritual perhaps can transcend political identity.”</p><p>The participation of people like Underwood is not going to change anyone’s mind about Trump, Thompson said. It could, however, change minds about the artist. On social media, some declared they were going to delete Underwood’s songs from their playlists.</p><h3 id="h2_%E2%80%98four_long_years_of_american_decline%3A%E2%80%99_trump_rally_speech_echoed_his_campaign">‘Four long years of American decline:’ Trump rally speech echoed his campaign</h3><p>Addressing a packed crowd at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., Trump stayed consistent with the framing he often used in his campaign.</p><p>He criticized Biden’s term as a “failed administration” and promised to “end the reign of a failed and corrupt political establishment.”</p><p>“Tomorrow, at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride,” he told supporters.</p><h3 id="h2_eight_years_ago%2C_stars_avoided_trump_inauguration._this_time_it%E2%80%99s_different">Eight years ago, stars avoided Trump inauguration. This time it’s different</h3><p>Carrie Underwood might not be Beyoncé or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem. But the singer’s participation in President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides, where mainstream entertainers, from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly, more enthusiastically associating with the new administration.</p><p>Eight years ago, Trump reportedly struggled to enlist stars to be part of the swearing-in and the various glitzy balls that follow. The concurrent protest marches around the nation had more famous entertainers than the swearing-in.</p><p>There were always some celebrity Trump supporters, like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Jon Voight, Rosanne Barr, Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman, to name a few. But Trump’s victory this time around was decisive and while Hollywood may always skew largely liberal, the slate of names participating in his inauguration weekend events has improved.</p><p>Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People, Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include the rapper Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_plans_to_sign_a_lot_of_executive_orders_today">Trump plans to sign a lot of executive orders today</h3><p>Trump forecast signing as many as 100 executive orders on his first day, possibly covering deportations, the U.S.-Mexico border, domestic energy, Schedule F rules for federal workers, school gender policies and vaccine mandates, among other Day 1 promises made during his campaign. He’s also promised an executive order to give more time for the sale of TikTok.</p><p>Trump has asked Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., to write an order stopping the development of offshore windmills for generating electricity.</p><p>Many of the Republican’s measures are likely to draw Democratic opposition.</p><p>And in several major cases, the orders will largely be statements of intent based off campaign promises made by Trump.</p><h3 id="h2_capitol_flag_at_full_height_for_trump">Capitol flag at full height for Trump</h3><p>The U.S. flag over the Capitol will be flying at full-staff for Donald Trump’s swearing-in.</p><p>That’s despite an order from President Joe Biden that flags be lowered for 30 days following the Dec. 29 death of former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
