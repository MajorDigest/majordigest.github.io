    <p>It’s Day 22 of the federal government shutdown, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to end it.</p><p>Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they&#x27;ll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls &quot;Democrat programs.&quot; </p><p><em>Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.</em></p><p>As the shutdown drags on, here&#x27;s the latest on what we know.</p><p><em>Jump to state-specific impacts.</em></p><h3 id="h2_why_did_the_federal_government_shut_down%3F_">Why did the federal government shut down? </h3><p>A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don&#x27;t have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.  </p><p>Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.</p><p>Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer. </p><p>NPR&#x27;s Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.</p><p> In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. </p><p><em>Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.</em> </p><p><em>Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as </em><em>a health care showdown</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>— </em><em>Selena Simmons-Duffin</em><em>, NPR</em></p><h3 id="h2_will_the_military_get_paid_on_oct._29%3F__">Will the military get paid on Oct. 29?  </h3><p>The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn&#x27;t miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday. </p><p>Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.</p><h3 id="h2_are_government_workers_being_laid_off_during_the_shutdown%3F">Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?</h3><p>The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees.</p><p><em>Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order</em>  </p><h3 id="h2_what_about_wic_and_snap_benefits%3F">What about WIC and SNAP benefits?</h3><p>Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump&#x27;s budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding. </p><p>Beyond WIC, the country&#x27;s much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October. </p><p>That&#x27;s because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, &quot;until further notice.&quot;</p><p><em>— </em><em>Jennifer Ludden</em><em>, NPR</em></p><h3 id="h2_and_what_about_school_lunches%3F">And what about school lunches?</h3><p>Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.</p><p>Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don&#x27;t have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.</p><p>&quot;There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.&quot;</p><p>According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist. </p><p>— <em>Kadin Mills,</em><em> NPR</em></p><h3 id="h2_usps_is_%E2%80%98open_for_business_as_usual%E2%80%99">USPS is ‘open for business as usual’</h3><p>&quot;U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,&quot; according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn&#x27;t depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.</p><h3 id="h2_irs_furloughs_nearly_half_its_staff">IRS furloughs nearly half its staff</h3><p>A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS&#x27; approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.</p><p>The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year&#x27;s tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data. </p><p><em>— </em><em>Scott Horsley</em><em>, </em>Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, <em>NPR</em></p><h3 id="h2_teachers_and_schools_won%E2%80%99t_be_directly_impacted%2C_but_federal_education_functions_might">Teachers and schools won’t be directly impacted, but federal education functions might</h3><p>Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans. </p><p>At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. </p><p>This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation&#x27;s more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff. </p><p>In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees&#x27; out-of-office email messages.</p><p><em>— </em><em>Shannon Bond</em><em> and </em><em>Cory Turner</em><em>, NPR</em></p><p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR&#x27;s Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.</p><h3 id="h2_national_parks_are_a_mixed_bag">National Parks are a mixed bag</h3><p>Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR&#x27;s Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo&#x27;s closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.</p><p>As KQED&#x27;s Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails &quot;will generally remain accessible to visitors&quot; for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.</p><p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.</p><h3 id="h2_salem_will_be_open_through_halloween_thanks_to_community_support">Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support</h3><p> WBUR&#x27;s Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open. </p><p>Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.</p><h3 id="h2_medicare%2C_medicaid_and_social_security_benefits_will_continue">Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue</h3><p>Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. </p><p>But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR&#x27;s Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits. </p><p>In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.</p><p>As NPR&#x27;s Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late. </p><p><em>Read more on </em><em>how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown</em><em> from NPR&#x27;s Selena Simmons-Duffin.</em></p><h3 id="h2_ice_will_mostly_continue_uninterrupted">ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted</h3><p>Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. &quot;We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,&quot; McLaughlin said.</p><p>According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.</p><p>&quot;More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,&quot; Noem posted on X on Thursday. &quot;By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a &quot;super check&quot; – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.&quot;</p><p>The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.</p><p><em>— </em><em>Ximena Bustillo</em><em>, NPR</em></p><h3 id="h2_if_you&#x27;re_flying_soon_%E2%80%A6">If you&#x27;re flying soon …</h3><p>Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered &quot;essential workers&quot; and have to stay on the job.</p><p>Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country. </p><p>Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A &quot;slight increase&quot; in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.</p><p><em>Read more on</em><em> what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown</em><em> from NPR&#x27;s Joel Rose.</em></p><h3 id="h2_the_impact_of_the_shutdown_looks_different_in_different_parts_of_the_country">The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country</h3><p>Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown.

Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn&#x27;t learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors.
