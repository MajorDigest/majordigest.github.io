    <p>The United States and South Korea advanced trade talks on Wednesday, addressing details of $350 billion that would be invested in the American economy, after negotiations and ceremonies that included the presentation of a gold medal and crown to President Donald Trump.</p><p>Both were gifts from the country’s president, Lee Jae Myung, who dialed up the flattery while Washington and Seoul worked to nail down financial promises during the last stop of Trump’s Asia trip.</p><p>Although both sides said progress has been made — Trump said things were “pretty much finalized” — no agreement has been signed yet. The framework includes gradual investments, cooperation on shipbuilding and the lowering of Trump’s tariffs on South Korea’s automobile exports, according to Kim Yong-beom, Lee’s chief of staff for policy. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Here's the latest:</p><p>Louisiana plan to pay for SNAP benefits likely won’t include ‘able-bodied’ recipients</p><p>Republican Gov. Jeff Landry says most of Louisiana’s SNAP recipients can plan on receiving November benefits, but about 53,000 “able-bodied” recipients — who don’t share a household with children or disabled or older people — will be excluded from receiving funds.</p><p>A bipartisan move by the Legislature authorized $150 million in state funds to fill the expected federal lapse.</p><p>Nearly 800,000 Louisiana residents, or one-fifth of the population, are SNAP recipients.</p><p>During a press conference Wednesday, Landry said SNAP recipients who are older or disabled — or SNAP recipient households with children or disabled or older people — can expect to receive their regular benefits under state funds.</p><p>“Our priorities are specific, we’re going to protect the most vulnerable population in Louisiana,” Landry said.</p><p>Landry urged SNAP recipients who are ineligible to receive state funds to lean on food banks for help and seek job opportunities.</p><p>Appeals court blocks order requiring Border Patrol official to brief judge on immigration sweeps</p><p>The court intervened Wednesday before Greg Bovino’s first late afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis.</p><p>Ellis wanted daily briefings after seeing video and other images of confrontations between immigration agents and the public. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents in the city.</p><p>▶ Read more about the blocked order</p><p>Democrats spotlight Obama, party stars to push California plan to boost U.S. House seats</p><p>Democrats are ending the campaign to boost the party’s U.S. House seats in California with a burst of political star power.</p><p>Former President Barack Obama headlines a new ad that urges voters to approve so-called Proposition 50, which if approved would realign district boundaries to give Democrats as many as five additional seats in a bid to capture the majority next year and beat back Trump’s attempts to gain more Republican districts in Texas and other states.</p><p>Voting concludes Nov. 4. Democrats who put in a pitch for the proposal in the 30-second spot include Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom — who spearheaded the proposal — looks into the camera and says, “You have the power to stand up to Donald Trump.” </p><p>The ad was released on the same day a Public Policy Institute of California statewide poll found that 56% of likely voters would support the proposition if the election was held today. The poll from the nonpartisan institute said 43% were opposed and 1% had no opinion.</p><p>Deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago area remains blocked for now</p><p>The Trump administration will be unable to deploy Guard troops to help with its immigration crackdown until at least the latter half of November, following a Supreme Court order Wednesday calling for more briefing.</p><p>The justices did not act on the administration’s emergency appeal of a lower court ruling that has blocked the deployment of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas.</p><p>The court set a Nov. 17 deadline for the final submissions, making it unlikely the justices will take action before then.</p><p>Shutdown to have negative economic effect, but that can be reversed, CBO says</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office laid out the stakes of the government shutdown at Thursday’s four-week mark, or if it keeps going longer, in response to a request from the House Budget Committee’s GOP chairman.</p><p>“The effects of the shutdown on the economy are uncertain,” the CBO said. “Those effects depend on decisions made by the Administration throughout the shutdown.”</p><p>The CBO estimates that the shutdown will reduce GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 by as much as 2 percentage points. But it said most of the decline eventually will be recovered.</p><p>Much of the spending that was halted on government pay and programs the CBO expects “will be made up” once government reopens.</p><p>Using estimates from the federal agencies and the White House’s budget office, it also said about 650,000 employees will be furloughed, on average, fewer than an initial assessment.</p><p>Effort to fund SNAP benefits fails in Senate</p><p>The Senate has blocked an effort to fast-track a bill that would keep two food assistance programs open during the government shutdown.</p><p>Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., sought unanimous consent to approve his bill to fund SNAP benefits, which the Trump administration says will end Saturday. The bill also would continue funding for a program that helps low-income mothers and children, known as WIC.</p><p>Lujan said the Trump administration should use billions of dollars in a contingency fund to pay for benefits during the shutdown.</p><p>“This pain does not need to happen,” Lujan said.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Republicans have voted 13 times to fund SNAP and WIC as part of a short-term funding bill.</p><p>“We’re not going to pick winners and losers. It’s time to fund everybody,” Thune said before objecting to Lujan’s request, hence blocking it.</p><p>Louisiana lawmakers authorize $150 million in state money to be used to avoid lapse in SNAP benefits</p><p>In a bipartisan effort, Louisiana lawmakers on Wednesday authorized $150 million in state funding to be used to avoid next month’s expected interruption in SNAP benefits.</p><p>The action still needs approval from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who was the one who urged the Legislature to craft the resolution.</p><p>State Senate President Cameron Henry, a Republican, said his intent is for all Louisiana SNAP recipients — nearly 800,000 people — to receive their full monthly benefit amount. The resolution received near-unanimous approval on Wednesday with only one lawmaker voting against it.</p><p>In Louisiana, a state that is among the most impoverished and where nearly one-fifth of the population receives SNAP benefits, politicians say it’s imperative that there isn’t a lapse in food aid.</p><p>If the federal lapse extends beyond November, lawmakers say they will consider funding another month of benefits using a state savings account. However, tapping into the account requires more time and approval.</p><p>Federal Reserve cuts key rate as government shutdown clouds economic outlook</p><p>The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year as it seeks to shore up economic growth and hiring even as inflation stays elevated.</p><p>“Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August,” the Fed said in a statement Wednesday. “More recent indicators are consistent with these developments.” The government hasn’t issued unemployment data after August because of the shutdown. The Fed is watching private-sector figures instead.</p><p>Wednesday’s decision brings the Fed’s key rate down to about 3.9%, from about 4.1%. The central bank had cranked its rate to roughly 5.3% in 2023 and 2024 to combat the biggest inflation spike in four decades. Lower rates could, over time, reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as for business loans.</p><p>▶ Read more about FED cuts</p><p>Top Senate Democrat on armed services committee warns that Trump is politicizing the military</p><p>Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech that Trump’s move to involve the military in his political goals is endangering how Americans see U.S. troops.</p><p>Reed, who represents Rhode Island, challenged his Republican colleagues to speak against how Trump has taken rare moves to enmesh the military with politics.</p><p>“Once the military becomes politicized, it loses the trust of the American people. A military seen as serving a political party cannot claim to serve the nation,” Reed said.</p><p>Tribes declare states of emergency ahead of loss of SNAP benefits</p><p>Several tribal nations have declared a state of emergency in response to the federal shutdown and the upcoming loss of SNAP benefits.</p><p>In Montana, the Blackfeet Nation called the loss of SNAP benefits a “crisis” in its declaration, and in North Dakota, both the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Spirit Lake Nation made similar declarations to access emergency funding.</p><p>The majority of those utilizing the food assistance program in the Spirit Lake Nation are children, said Chairwoman Lonna Jackson-Street.</p><p>“If our kids can’t eat, then we’re all in crisis,” Street said. Winters can be particularly tough for the Spirit Lake Nation, which is about 80 miles from the Canadian border, and Street is worried that if the shutdown continues into the winter months some tribal citizens will have to choose between filling their propane tanks and buying groceries. “My fear is people are going to die.”</p><p>Top congressional Republicans overseeing military speak out against US troop withdrawal from Romania</p><p>Sen. Roger Wicker and Rep. Mike Rogers, who chair their respective congressional committees on armed services, have issued a joint statement saying they “strongly oppose” the Trump administration’s decision not to send U.S. troops back to Romania.</p><p>“This decision also sends the wrong signal to Russia at the very moment President Trump is applying pressure to force Vladimir Putin to come to the table to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine,” the two Republican lawmakers say.</p><p>The U.S. has stationed roughly 1,000 troops at an air base in Romania, but after they were rotated out a month ago, the Department of Defense has decided not to replace them.</p><p>The joint statement speaks to growing concern in Congress, including from some Republicans, about how Trump is reconfiguring the U.S. military’s footing around the globe.</p><p>House Democrats call on Trump to return to Washington and save SNAP</p><p>“If the president wanted to help feed hungry American children, he would,” said Rep. Angie Craig, the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee that handles the food aid program.</p><p>At a press conference at the Capitol, the Democrats said Trump has focused more on his priorities, including his new ballroom at the White House, than the everyday needs of Americans.</p><p>“I’m calling on the president to get back from Asia and do the right thing — and the moral thing,” Craig said.</p><p>“Where is the great dealmaker now?” asked Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C. “We’re ready to make a bipartisan deal that, first of all, would keep SNAP funded, that would reopen the government, that would extend the ACA tax credits — that would end the pain that’s being inflicted on the American people.”</p><p>Forecasting for Hurricane Melissa continued despite shutdown</p><p>National weather forecasters were able to provide critical warnings, collect satellite data and fly aircraft into the eye of powerful Hurricane Melissa during the government shutdown.</p><p>Experts say they saw no major problems with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s hurricane forecasting ability.</p><p>That work was critical ahead of Melissa’s landfall in Jamaica as a violent storm that is not expected to strike the United States. Many NOAA employees are considered essential, which means they are working during the shutdown without pay.</p><p>“They are carrying on as normal, without getting paid for their sometimes stressful and exhausting work,” said Kristen Corbosiero, professor and chair of the department of Atmospheric and environmental science at the University of Albany.</p><p>Weather forecasters have been among those hit by the Trump administration’s staff cuts, although some positions were reopened after concerns about dangerous understaffing.</p><p>US lifts sanctions against separatist Bosnian Serb leader</p><p>The United States on Wednesday lifted sanctions against separatist Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik and his family, turning back financial penalties that were imposed by the Biden administration in 2022.</p><p>Dodik is staunchly pro-Russian and has called for the Serb-run part of Bosnia to break off and join Serbia.</p><p>Until recently he was the president of the Bosnian Serb republic in Bosnia, sharing the tripartite presidency with a Bosniak and a Croat. Dodik agreed to step down this month after a Bosnian court banned him for politics over his separatist actions.</p><p>Dodik on X thanked Trump and his associates for “correcting a grave injustice.”</p><p>Vance said he has joked with Rubio about running for the White House together in 2028</p><p>Vance, speaking on the New York Post’s “Pod Force One” podcast, said he had brought it up “in jest” with Rubio after Trump said his vice president and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be “unstoppable” if they ran together on a presidential ticket.</p><p>He said he works with Rubio a lot and there would be no tension between them if they both considered campaigns for the presidency down the road.</p><p>“Marco is my best friend in the administration,” Vance said.</p><p>He said speculation about the 2028 presidential election is “feels so premature because we’re still so early.”</p><p>Vance said it is not a focus in his current role.</p><p>White House says deal to put TikTok under US ownership could be finalized in South Korea</p><p>The Trump administration has been signaling it may have finally reached a deal with China to keep TikTok running in the U.S., with the two countries finalizing it as soon as Thursday.</p><p>Trump is visiting South Korea, where he’ll meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to try to de-escalate a trade war.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the two leaders will “consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea.”</p><p>If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed — and President Joe Biden signed — a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it didn’t find a new owner in the place of China’s ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law’s January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.</p><p>▶ Read more about the Trump administration and TikTok</p><p>‘Window shopping’ opens for federal Affordable Care Act marketplace</p><p>The Trump administration has made 2026 Affordable Care Act health insurance plans available for enrollees to browse ahead of the start of the open enrollment period Saturday.</p><p>Americans who live in states that use the federally facilitated marketplace can now use the Healthcare.gov website to check the costs of next year’s plans, which are expected to rise sharply next year because of increasing health costs and expiring subsidies that have made the plans cheaper for consumers.</p><p>Window shopping was already available in many of the states that manage their own versions of the ACA marketplace.</p><p>The unveiling of next year’s plans comes after Democratic senators urged the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to make them available as soon as possible. Amid large-scale federal employee furloughs during the government shutdown, CMS temporarily brought back all its workers Monday, in part to help manage the ACA open enrollment period.</p><p>Senate Majority leader says talks with Democrats picking up, but leadership not involved</p><p>Sen. John Thune says there’s been a “higher level of conversation” with Democrats this week about reopening the government, but the underlying dynamics of the impasse in the Senate remain the same.</p><p>Thune told reporters Democratic leadership is “out of the equation” and he’s pressing rank and file Democrats to vote to reopen the government before the Senate takes up talks to extend health care benefits.</p><p>However, that’s the strategy he’s been pursuing since the shutdown started nearly a month ago.</p><p>Republican Senate Majority Leader dismisses Democratic SNAP funding bill amid shutdown fight</p><p>Sen. John Thune called the bill “a cynical attempt to buy political cover for Democrats to allow them to carry on their government shutdown even longer.”</p><p>Senate Democrats proposed a bill to extend funding during the government shutdown for two food assistance programs, SNAP and WIC, used by millions of low-income Americans.</p><p>Thune’s comments signal the legislation is unlikely to get the unanimous consent needed to pass the Senate on an expedited basis.</p><p>Thune also said he’s opposed to any bills that would only fund certain parts of the government.</p><p>“I think that the quickest way to end it is to just open everything up, and then everybody gets paid. You’re not picking winners and losers or having to explain to this group why you open it up for this group. I mean, that just doesn’t make any sense,” he told reporters.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture has announced that no SNAP benefits, formerly food stamps, will be issued Saturday.</p><p>Radio Free Asia to cease news production</p><p>The congressionally funded outlet that provides uncensored news to several countries in Asia has been targeted for cuts by the Trump administration and now faces further pain from the government shutdown.</p><p>Radio Free Asia said Wednesday that it will halt all news production starting Friday for the first time in its 29-year history.</p><p>In a statement, CEO and President Bay Fang said RFA will start shuttering overseas bureaus and formally lay off furloughed staff.</p><p>She called the move “an effort to conserve limited resources on hand and preserve the possibility of restarting operations should consistent funding become available.”</p><p>Speaker Johnson says Democrats have ‘soul searching’ to do as government shutdown intensifies</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson opened his daily news conference at the Capitol with a shrug of resignation on day 29 of the shutdown.</p><p>“Here we are again,” the GOP leader said.</p><p>He said it’s time for Democrats to drop their demands — they’re fighting for health care funds — and reopen government before Saturday’s deadlines. That’s when food aid benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are set to shutter.</p><p>“We pray that Senate Democrats come to their senses before the situation becomes too dire on Saturday,” he said. “This gets very real.”</p><p>South Korea says Trump has proposed talks on South Korea’s wish to acquire nuclear-powered subs</p><p>National security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters Trump made such comments during talks with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday.</p><p>Lee earlier said at the opening of talks with Trump that South Korea doesn’t intend to build nuclear-armed submarines but needs conventionally armed, nuclear-powered ones that are capable of operating quietly underwater for extended periods. He said the country’s diesel submarines are constrained in their ability to track submarines from North Korea or China. His office later clarified that Lee wasn’t referring to submarines from specific nations, but those that travel near South Korean waters.</p><p>Wi quoted Trump as stressing the need to bolster the allies’ deterrence capabilities to better deal with North Korean nuclear threats.</p><p>Wi says Trump also expressed his intention to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>South Korea announces agreement with the US on an investment package</p><p>Seoul says the leaders of South Korea and the U.S. have agreed that South Korea’s promised $350 billion investment package will be divided into $200 billion in direct cash payments and $150 billion in investment in shipbuilding.</p><p>Kim Yong-beom, presidential chief of staff for policy, made the announcement after a meeting with Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.</p><p>Kim says the two leaders agreed the $200 billion cash payments will be made an annual cap of $20 billion and the $150 billion on shipbuilding cooperation includes loan guarantees.</p><p>Kim says U.S. tariffs on auto will be lowered to 15%.</p><p>Trump says he’s made progress on trade with South Korea</p><p>“We made our deal pretty much finalized,” Trump said in opening remarks at the dinner. He didn’t provide any details about the deal with South Korea, and neither has the White House.</p><p>A sticking point in negotiations has been Trump’s desire for South Korea to invest $350 billion in the United States.</p><p>Korean officials say putting up cash could destabilize their own economy, and they’d rather offer loans and loan guarantees instead.</p><p>China says it is willing to work with US to ‘inject new momentum’ into bilateral relationship</p><p>China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry says it is willing to work with the U.S. to “inject new momentum” into the bilateral relationship ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Xi on Thursday.</p><p>“Head-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable strategic role in guiding China–U.S. relations,” spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Wednesday.</p><p>Guo did not specify what actions China might take after Trump said he would lower fentanyl-related tariffs on China, but Guo noted Beijing remains open to cooperation.</p><p>“China sympathizes with the American people for the suffering caused by the fentanyl crisis and has provided assistance in this regard and achieved positive results,” Guo said.</p><p>However, “the U.S. should take concrete actions to create the necessary conditions for bilateral cooperation,” Guo added.</p><p>Anti-US protesters rally in South Korea</p><p>Dozens of anti-U.S. protesters were rallying near the venue where Trump and Lee were meeting for a summit.</p><p>Police said about 60 people were staging a sit-in demonstration on a street near Gyeongju National Museum where the Trump-Lee meeting was being held ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit set for later this week.</p><p>Police denied media reports that the protesters physically clashed with police.</p><p>Yonhap news agency said the protesters were holding placards that read “NO. Trump” and “Withdraw investments in the U.S.”</p><p>Police said several other anti-U.S. protests were also taking place in Gyeongju on Wednesday.</p><p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 hits record high as Trump’s charm offensive lifts Asian shares</p><p>Shares in Asia were mostly higher Wednesday as Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 2% to another record.</p><p>U.S. futures were mixed and oil prices were little changed.</p><p>Trump has been touring Asia, and his upbeat comments on relations with major economies like Japan and China have helped fuel rallies while U.S. stocks have pushed further into record heights.</p><p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was up 2.4% at 51,410.40. South Korea’s Kospi rose 1.2% to 4,058.37.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite index was up 0.5% at 4,006.21.
