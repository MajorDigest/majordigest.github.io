    <h3 id="h2_it%E2%80%99s_election_day_in_minnesota">It’s Election Day in Minnesota</h3><p>Most polling places in Minnesota are open at 7 a.m. for Election Day voting. Across the state, there are a number of municipal races and referendums. Here’s a look at some of the races we are watching.</p><h3 id="h3_special_elections%3A_minnesota_senate_control_in_play">Special elections: Minnesota Senate control in play</h3><p>Voters in a pair of Minnesota Senate districts have the potential to reorder party control of a closely divided chamber. Democrats currently have a narrow lead in their favor, with a 33-32 split. A Republican sweep would tip the scales in that party’s favor to go along with an evenly divided Minnesota House.</p><div class="apm-related-list"><div class="apm-related-list-title"> </div><ul class="apm-related-list-body"><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Pair of Minnesota Senate elections</span>will decide chamber control, set tone for 2026 campaigns</li></ul></div><p>In Senate District 29, composed of exurban and rural communities in Wright County, Republican Michael Holmstrom Jr. and DFL candidate Louis McNutt are after the open seat. In recent contests, the district has favored GOP candidates. The death of GOP Sen. Bruce Anderson led to the seat’s vacancy.</p><p>In Senate District 47, a region covering Woodbury and a section of Maplewood, DFL state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Republican candidate Dwight Dorau are on the ballot. The seat became vacant after the conviction of former DFL Sen. Nicole Mitchell.</p><h3 id="h3_minneapolis_and_st._paul_mayor_races">Minneapolis and St. Paul mayor races</h3><p>Voters in Minneapolis will have 15 candidates to choose from on election day. St. Paul voters will choose from five candidates. Both cities have incumbent mayors who are trying for rare third terms, Jacob Frey in Minneapolis and Melvin Carter in St. Paul. And both cities use ranked choice voting — instead of choosing just one candidate voters rank them in order of preference.</p><div class="apm-related-list"><div class="apm-related-list-title">Minneapolis voter resources</div><ul class="apm-related-list-body"><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Voter guide</span>2025 Minneapolis mayoral race</li><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Select a candidate</span>Which Minneapolis mayoral candidates do you agree with most?</li><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Watch</span>Minneapolis mayor candidates differ over policing, minimum wage at MPR News/Star Tribune debate</li></ul></div><div class="apm-related-list"><div class="apm-related-list-title">St. Paul voter resources</div><ul class="apm-related-list-body"><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Voter guide</span>2025 St. Paul mayoral race</li><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Select a candidate</span>Which St. Paul mayoral candidates do you agree with most?</li><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Watch</span>Mayoral candidates outline competing visions for St. Paul in MPR News/Pioneer Press debate</li><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">St. Paul voters to decide ballot measure</span>that would allow fines for ordinance violations</li></ul></div><h3 id="h2_duluth%E2%80%99s_%E2%80%98right_to_repair%E2%80%99_ballot_measure">Duluth’s ‘Right to Repair’ ballot measure</h3><p>The “Right to Repair” ballot measure in Duluth would allow renters to pay for minor repairs and deduct the cost from their rent if landlords fail to respond in a timely manner. </p><p>Here&#x27;s how it would work: A tenant would notify their landlord of a needed repair. Landlords would get two weeks to fix it. If they don&#x27;t, the tenant could do the work themselves or hire someone to do it and deduct the cost from their next rent payment — up to $500 or a half month&#x27;s rent, whichever is greater. </p><div class="apm-related-list"><div class="apm-related-list-title"> </div><ul class="apm-related-list-body"><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Duluth ballot initiative</span>would allow tenants to pay for repairs and deduct costs from their rent</li></ul></div><p>Advocates say it’s a common-sense approach that gives frustrated renters another tool to get simple repairs done in a timely manner. Skeptic say the ballot measure duplicates renter protections already available through the city of Duluth and state statute, and it could put renters at legal or financial risk if they pay for repairs that are later disputed by their landlords. </p><h3 id="h2_anoka-hennepin_school_board">Anoka-Hennepin School Board</h3><p>Six candidates are facing off over three seats this fall on the Anoka-Hennepin school board, and the money flooding into the races to oversee the state’s largest school district has far outpaced normal spending for a down-ballot election. </p><div class="apm-related-list"><div class="apm-related-list-title"> </div><ul class="apm-related-list-body"><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Election spending spikes</span>for school board races in Anoka-Hennepin district</li></ul></div><p>This year, 21 school districts statewide are holding regular elections. Twelve are planning special elections to replace board members who vacated their seats before the end of their terms. </p><h3 id="h2_stearns_county_commissioner">Stearns County Commissioner</h3><p>In the St. Cloud area, two candidates are vying for an open seat on the Stearns County board. One of them would be the state’s first Somali American county commissioner, according to the Association of Minnesota Counties.</p><p>Leigh Lenzmeier held the District 4 county commissioner seat for 34 years. He resigned in April, after his wife raised concerns about his cognitive decline. </p><div class="apm-related-list"><div class="apm-related-list-title"> </div><ul class="apm-related-list-body"><li class="apm-related-link"><span class="apm-related-link-prefix">Stearns County</span>holds election for board seat that hasn’t been vacant in more than three decades</li></ul></div><p>Amin Ali is a 39-year-old youth soccer coach, community advocate and housing program director. In his campaign kickoff speech, he listed his top priorities as public safety, jobs, youth opportunities and housing.</p><p>Bob Johnson, 76, was executive director of CentraCare&#x27;s Heart and Vascular Center for 23 years. He also led the Paramount Center for the Arts in St. Cloud for nine years and served three terms on the St. Cloud City Council.</p><h3 id="h2_what%E2%80%99s_on_my_ballot%3F">What’s on my ballot?</h3><p>MPR News’ Voter Guide will show you which races, candidates and ballot questions are on your ballot.
