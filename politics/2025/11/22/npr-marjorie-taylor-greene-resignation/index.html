    <p>Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene became a household name in the run up to the 2020 election<strong> </strong>for divisive rhetoric, political stunts and enthusiastic support of President Donald Trump. But after growing disagreements with Trump during his second term, Greene announced she will leave Congress in January before her term is up.</p><p>Greene said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them &quot;endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for&quot; while noting that &quot;Republicans will likely lose the midterms.&quot;</p><p>Greene&#x27;s split with Trump widened in recent weeks as she pushed for the release of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>For months, Greene had been publicly pressing Trump and top Republicans in Congress to release all files from two federal investigations into Epstein. She was part of a small cadre of Republicans who helped force a vote on the House floor to release the files — a process that drove Trump to reverse his position on the documents and led to near-unanimous support for the measure this week.</p><p>But before Trump reversed course, he lashed out last week, calling her &quot;Marjorie Traitor Greene,&quot; and told reporters, &quot;Something happened to her over the last period of a month or two where she changed politically.&quot;</p><p>In her post Friday night, Greene defended her decision to fight for the release of those documents. </p><p>&quot;Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,&quot; Greene wrote.</p><h3 id="h2_greene&#x27;s_defiant_push_against_trump">Greene&#x27;s defiant push against Trump</h3><p>On a brisk morning this week, Greene stood outside the Capitol with some of the women who say they were abused by Epstein.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ve never owed him anything,&quot; Greene of the president on Tuesday. &quot;But I fought for him and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.&quot;</p><p>The cracks between Trump and Greene grew over the last year, as Greene increasingly pointed out where she saw the president falling short: she called the war in Gaza a genocide, criticized Trump&#x27;s decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, and pressed for expiring health subsidies to be extended, citing the threat of skyrocketing premiums for people in her district, including her own children.</p><p>And she was doing it not just on social media or right-wing outlets, but on programs like ABC&#x27;s <em>The View</em>.</p><h3 id="h2_%22what_happened_to_marjorie%3F%22">&quot;What Happened to Marjorie?&quot;</h3><p>&quot;I was thinking, if this was the first time I&#x27;d ever seen this person, it sounds like a normal congressperson from Schoolhouse Rock,&quot; said University of North Georgia professor Nathan Price after Greene&#x27;s appearance on the daytime television staple.</p><p>For some, this new persona may be hard to square with the Greene many Americans first got to know: the congresswoman who embraced QAnon conspiracy theories, liked a post that called for violence against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. and heckled school shooting survivor David Hogg in 2020, before he became a prominent political activist.</p><p>Even Trump has publicly mused in recent weeks: &quot;What happened to Marjorie?&quot;</p><p>Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson says it&#x27;s a fair question.</p><p>&quot;I am open to the idea that she&#x27;s had a &#x27;road to Damascus&#x27; moment, a conversion, that she sees the errors of the toxicity and wants something that&#x27;s better,&quot; Robinson said in an interview with NPR earlier in the week.</p><p>On her own social media and with journalists, Greene has been open about addressing claims from Trump and others that she has changed or abandoned the president. NPR reached out to Greene for further comment.</p><p>&quot;Nothing has changed about me,&quot; Greene told the hosts of <em>The View</em>. &quot;I&#x27;m staying absolutely 100% true to the people who voted for me, and true to my district.&quot;</p><p>Robinson said the changes could be part of a natural evolution for Greene, a former CrossFit gym owner from the Atlanta suburbs.</p><p>&quot;We love to elect outsiders to Congress,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;They go to Congress with very little idea of how it works. And if at some point you&#x27;re like, &#x27;I want to do substantive things that make America better, then I&#x27;ve got to do this a little bit different.&quot;</p><p>Or, Robinson said, she may be trying to broaden her appeal with an important constituency as she weighs a bid for higher office. Trump said last week he showed Greene polling earlier this year suggesting she would flounder in a race for Georgia governor or Senate.</p><p>&quot;Is she intentionally signaling to women, &#x27;The good old boys club ignores us, and I understand your struggles?&quot; Robinson said.</p><p>Both Robinson and Price said Greene&#x27;s evolution was more about style than substance. She has disavowed some of her more controversial views, but not others, like the unproven assertion that widespread fraud upended the 2020 election result.</p><p>The anti-interventionist, anti-elite principles that first propelled her to Congress also remain core to her identity. &quot;What she&#x27;s responding to is believing that the President has shifted on these issues,&quot; said Price.</p><p>Some potential political opponents see an opportunity in Greene&#x27;s break with Trump. Robinson, who worked for Greene&#x27;s opponent in her first primary race, says in the past he has warned potential challengers not to underestimate her.</p><p>&quot;You are wasting your time,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;She will beat you. And I would have said that into infinity until this week.&quot;</p><h3 id="h2_how_greene&#x27;s_district_reacted_to_the_shift">How Greene&#x27;s district reacted to the shift</h3><p>But in the 14th Congressional District, it was not clear this week that anything had changed. As chair of the Paulding County Republican Party, Ricky Hess spends a lot of time talking with voters.</p><p>&quot;The issues that they want to talk about involve high property taxes, high health care costs, whether or not their kids will be able to buy a house when they graduate,&quot; Hess said this week ahead of Greene&#x27;s resignation<strong>.</strong> </p><p>Hess told NPR he believes<strong> </strong>Greene&#x27;s &quot;America First&quot; worldview resonates in this heavily working class and rural stretch of Northwest Georgia.</p><p>&quot;She&#x27;s pretty tapped into what her constituents are wanting, and I have to believe that most of her actions are in service to that,&quot; Hess said.</p><p>Hess said voters saw Trump and Greene as fighters on the same team. Though Martha Zoller, who hosts a political talk radio show that airs across North Georgia, said in an interview Wednesday she didn&#x27;t believe everyone&#x27;s minds were made up.</p><p>&quot;People are kind of reeling, if you want to know the truth,&quot; Zoller said. &quot;We haven&#x27;t had a lot of listeners discussing it because they&#x27;re waiting to see what happens.&quot;</p><p>Georgia political observers noted that Greene has been anything but a predictable politician — including her surprise resignation. </p><p>Trump has come to a truce with other politicians he&#x27;s feuded with, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. And his future relationship with Greene could still evolve.</p><p>But Zoller said the conflict between Trump and Greene has been about more than just two big personalities falling out on the national stage.</p><p>&quot;I think that the big discussion we&#x27;re going to be having as Republicans over the next few years is what is the Republican movement once it&#x27;s not Trump?&quot;</p><p>Zoller said earlier this week it seemed clear that Greene wants to be part of that discussion. But with her resignation, the answer to that question is may be less clear  now than before.<br/></p><p><em>NPR&#x27;s Stephen Fowler contributed to this report.</em></p><p><em>Copyright 2025, NPR</em></p>
