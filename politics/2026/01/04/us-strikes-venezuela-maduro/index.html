    <p>The United States hit Venezuela with a “large-scale strike” early Saturday and said President Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country after months of stepped-up pressure by Washington. President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and was already doing so.</p><p>The legal authority for the strike — and whether Trump consulted Congress beforehand — was not immediately clear. The stunning, lightning-fast American military action, which plucked a nation’s sitting leader from office, echoed the U.S. invasion of Panama that led to the surrender and seizure of its leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, in 1990 — exactly 36 years ago Saturday.</p><p>Maduro and his wife, captured overnight from their home, were being transported via a U.S. warship to New York, where they were to face criminal charges. The U.S. is now evaluating next steps for Venezuela, Trump said Saturday on Fox News, “We’ll be involved in it very much.”</p><p>Here&#x27;s the latest:</p><h3 id="h2_schumer_says_trump_actions_in_venezuela_%E2%80%98reckless%E2%80%99">Schumer says Trump actions in Venezuela ‘reckless’</h3><p>The Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”</p><p>Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.</p><p>“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.</p><h3 id="h2_minnesotans_reacting_to_news_of_u.s._operations_in_venezuela">Minnesotans reacting to news of U.S. operations in Venezuela</h3><p>Reaction to the U.S. action in Venezuela has been divided in Minnesota, including among local Venezuelan Americans.<br/><br/>While some are concerned about the military intervention, others celebrated the news.</p><p>Soleil Ramirez, a St. Paul chef and restaurant owner, said Venezuela has “a little bit of light” for the first time in years.</p><p>“I have never had so many mixed feelings in my life before. I’m happy. I’ve been crying. I’ve been screaming. I’ve been praying. I’m super anxious right now, but I’m very happy,” said Ramirez.</p><p>“We have never thought any country in the world would help us to get rid of this dictatorship,” she added.</p><p>Ramirez said she sought asylum in the U.S. ten years ago after Venezuelan officials seized her property and threatened her life. She welcomes international involvement in the country to ensure a transition to a representative government.</p><p>&quot;People who is still living in Venezuela, they don&#x27;t have more energy for anything,” said Ramirez. “You know, how many people have left Venezuela? It&#x27;s almost seven million. The people who stay in Venezuela, they are barely surviving. So finally, finally, we have international support.”</p><p>U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., criticized the administration’s military strikes on Venezuela, saying Congress must authorize any deployment of U.S. forces. “We should not put Americans at risk in this way without careful deliberation among the people’s elected representatives,” Klobuchar said, warning that wars for regime change can lead to unintended consequences. </p><p>She called for a full briefing and a vote to stop what she described as unauthorized action.</p><p>In Minneapolis, around 300 people rallied on Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue to oppose the actions. The Minnesota Peace Action Coalition announced an emergency protest Saturday, accusing the U.S. of escalating military conflict in Venezuela and calling for an end to what it described as a war driven by oil interests.</p><p>Demonstrators likened Trump’s justification for the attack to rhetoric leading to the 2003 war on Iraq.</p><p>“Drug trafficking in Venezuela is this generation&#x27;s ‘weapons of mass destruction,’” said Arroyo Garcia-Torres, an organizer with the Solidarity Committee on the Americas.</p><p>“This is not something that the American public wants,” said Meredith Aby, an organizer with the Anti-War Committee.</p><div class="apm-gallery"><div class="apm-gallery_title">Photos: Minneapolis protest over U.S. military action in Venezuela</div><div class="apm-gallery_slides"><div id="slideshow" data-testid="slideshow" class="slideshow"><button aria-haspopup="dialog" data-testid="fullscreen-button" class="slideshow_fullscreen"><svg class="icon icon-fullscreen slideshow_icon slideshow_icon-fullscreen" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M6.987 10.987l-2.931 3.031-2.056-2.429v6.411h6.387l-2.43-2.081 3.030-2.932-2-2zM11.613 2l2.43 2.081-3.030 2.932 2 2 2.931-3.031 2.056 2.429v-6.411h-6.387z"></path></svg><span class="invisible" data-testid="icon-fullscreen">Fullscreen Slideshow</span></button><button data-testid="prev-button" aria-label="Icon Chevron Left" class="slideshow_button slideshow_button-prev"><svg class="icon icon-chevronLeft slideshow_icon" width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M48.2 47.4L30 47.4C28.9 47.4 28 46.5 28 45.4L28 44.3C28 43.2 28.9 42.3 30 42.3L46.2 42.3 46.2 26.1C46.2 25 47.1 24.1 48.2 24.1L49.4 24.1C50.5 24.1 51.4 25 51.4 26.1L51.4 45.4C51.4 46.5 50.5 47.4 49.4 47.4L48.2 47.4Z" fill="#FFFFFF" transform="translate(21, 18) rotate(135) translate(-39.7, -35.8)"></path></g></svg><span class="invisible">Previous Slide</span></button><div class="slideshow_container" aria-modal="false" aria-label="Slideshow container"><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">3 of 3</div></div></div><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">1 of 3</div></div></div><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">2 of 3</div></div></div></div><button data-testid="next-button" aria-label="Icon Chevron Right" class="slideshow_button slideshow_button-next"><svg class="icon icon-chevronRight slideshow_icon" width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M39.2 47.4L21 47.4C19.9 47.4 19 46.5 19 45.4L19 44.3C19 43.2 19.9 42.3 21 42.3L37.2 42.3 37.2 26.1C37.2 25 38.1 24.1 39.2 24.1L40.4 24.1C41.5 24.1 42.4 25 42.4 26.1L42.4 45.4C42.4 46.5 41.5 47.4 40.4 47.4L39.2 47.4Z" fill="#FFFFFF" transform="translate(12, 18) rotate(-45) translate(-30.7, -35.8) "></path></g></svg><span class="invisible">Next Slide</span></button><div id="slideshowBg" role="figure" data-testid="slideshowBg" class="slideshow_bg"></div></div></div></div><h3 id="h2_rubio_hints_cuba_could_be_next_after_trump_takes_maduro_out_of_venezuela">Rubio hints Cuba could be next after Trump takes Maduro out of Venezuela</h3><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Rubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.</p><p>The U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.</p><h3 id="h2_venezuela&#x27;s_un_ambassador_says_his_country_has_right_to_self_defense">Venezuela&#x27;s UN ambassador says his country has right to self defense</h3><p>In a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.”</p><p>The letter from Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.</p><p>“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: this is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_says_venezuelan_vice_president_delcy_rodr%C3%ADguez_sworn_in_as_president">Trump says Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as president</h3><p>U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as president shortly before he spoke to reporters and added she had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>“She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,” Trump said.</p><p>Earlier, opposition leader María Corina Machado said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_shares_photo_of_captured_maduro">Trump shares photo of captured Maduro</h3><p>The president posted a photo on social media showing Maduro wearing a sweatsuit and a blindfold with the caption: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”</p><p>Maduro appeared to be wearing a flotation device around his neck. Next to him was someone wearing a jacket that had a DEA logo.</p><p>Maduro also had protective headphones on his ears and appeared to be lifting a water bottle with both arms to drink.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_says_he_spoke_to_maduro_as_recently_as_last_week">Trump says he spoke to Maduro as recently as last week</h3><p>Trump told Fox News he spoke to Maduro several times, including most recently a week ago.</p><p>Maduro denied that in an interview on New Year’s Eve, saying he had only spoken to Trump in November.</p><h3 id="h2_trump%E2%80%99s_action_against_maduro_contrasts_with_clemency_granted_to_ex-honduras_leader">Trump’s action against Maduro contrasts with clemency granted to ex-Honduras leader</h3><p>Trump’s dramatic action against Maduro is the polar opposite of the clemency he granted to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández.</p><p>Trump in December pardoned Hernández though he was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers to safely move hundreds of tons of cocaine north through his country to the U.S.</p><p>Hernández, who enjoyed support from officials in the first Trump administration, was convicted by a U.S. jury in New York — which Maduro is now set to face.</p><p>When asked in an interview with Politico about the pardon, Trump said, “I don’t know him” and “I know very little about him,” but added that he was told that Hernández “was set up.”</p><p>“The country, uh, deals in drugs, like probably you could say that about every country, and because he was the president, they gave him like 45 years in prison,” he said.</p><h3 id="h2_justice_department_released_a_new_indictment_of_maduro_and_wife">Justice Department released a new indictment of Maduro and wife</h3><p>The indictment accuses Maduro of leading a “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.” It alleges that the drug trafficking efforts “enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite.”</p><p>U.S. authorities allege that Maduro partnered with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to bring tons of cocaine into the U.S., according to the indictment.</p><p>Authorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. The drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.</p><h3 id="h2_un_is_%E2%80%98deeply_alarmed%E2%80%99_by_the_us_strike">UN is ‘deeply alarmed’ by the US strike</h3><p>The United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.</p><p>“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.</p><h3 id="h2_china_slams_us_strike_in_venezuela">China slams US strike in Venezuela</h3><p>China strongly condemned the U.S. strike in Venezuela and the action against its president, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the Beijing government was “deeply shocked” and firmly opposed to the operation.</p><p>“Such hegemonic acts of the U.S. seriously violate international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,” it said.</p><p>It called on the U.S. to comply with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter, urging it to stop violating the sovereignty and security of other nations.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_says_a_helicopter_was_hit_and_%E2%80%98a_few%E2%80%99_us_members_were_injured_in_venezuela">Trump says a helicopter was hit and ‘a few’ US members were injured in Venezuela</h3><p>Trump said a helicopter was hit during the operation in Venezuela and a few U.S. members were injured, but he believed none were killed.</p><p>“A couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he said.</p><p>He said the U.S. lost no aircraft in the operation.</p><p>“We got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard but—a helicopter—but we got it back.</p><p>“We had to do it because it’s a war,” he added a few moments later.</p><h3 id="h2_faa_imposes_airspace_restriction_on_puerto_rico">FAA imposes airspace restriction on Puerto Rico</h3><p>The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed a temporary airspace restriction on Puerto Rico’s international airport and surrounding regions.</p><p>An announcement by Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan posted on the social media site X said the restriction was placed because of the “security situation related to military activity” in Venezuela.</p><p>As a result, most commercial airlines to and from the airport that are operated by U.S. airlines have been suspended or may be canceled.</p><p>Foreign airlines and military aircraft are not included in this restriction, the statement said. “Passengers are urged to check the status of their flight directly with their airline before heading to the airport.”</p><h3 id="h2_trump_dismisses_criticism_he_did_not_seek_congressional_permission_for_venezuela_strike">Trump dismisses criticism he did not seek congressional permission for Venezuela strike</h3><p>Trump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blaming his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.</p><p>He said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”</p><p>“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.</p><p>“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_says_he_proposed_to_the_mexican_president_that_us_take_out_cartels">Trump says he proposed to the Mexican president that US take out cartels</h3><p>Trump said the operation in Venezuela “wasn’t meant to be” a message to Mexico, but then he has proposed to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that the U.S. “take out” cartels in her country and suggested the U.S. might take action.</p><p>“We’re very friendly with her, she’s a good woman. But the cartels are running Mexico. She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump said.</p><p>He said he’s asked Sheinbaum numerous times, “Would you like us to take out the cartels?” but she has said no.</p><p>“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” Trump said.</p><h3 id="h2_maduro_and_his_wife_are_on_a_us_warship%2C_trump_says">Maduro and his wife are on a US warship, Trump says</h3><p>Trump told Fox News that the couple were aboard the U.S. warship Iwo Jima and headed to New York, where they will face prosecution.</p><h3 id="h2_trump_says_us_will_decide_on_what%E2%80%99s_next_for_venezuela">Trump says US will decide on what’s next for Venezuela</h3><p>President Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday morning that the United States will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela after capturing the Latin American country’s president and flying him out of the country.</p><p>“We’ll be involved in it very much” as to who will govern the country, Trump said.</p><p>“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News hours after the capture.</p><h3 id="h2_maduro_was_at_his_home_when_he_was_seized_in_us_operation%2C_party_leader_tells_ap">Maduro was at his home when he was seized in US operation, party leader tells AP</h3><p>Venezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.</p><p>“That’s where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”</p><h3 id="h2_vice_president_jd_vance_says_maduro_found_out_that_trump_%E2%80%98means_what_he_says%E2%80%99">Vice President JD Vance says Maduro found out that Trump ‘means what he says’</h3><p>Vice President JD Vance said in a statement on X: “The president offered multiple off ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States. Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says.</p><p>Kudos to our brave special operators who pulled off a truly impressive operation.”</p><h3 id="h2_celebrations_erupt_in_venezuelan_community_in_south_florida">Celebrations erupt in Venezuelan community in South Florida</h3><p>In South Florida, Venezuelans celebrated the news of Maduro’s capture at a rally held outside a South American eatery.</p><p>People wrapped themselves in Venezuelan flags, ate fried snacks and cheered as music was playing at the event. At one point, the crowd chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”</p><p>The rally took place in Doral, Florida, a city of 80,000 people surrounded by Miami sprawl and home to the largest Venezuelan community in the United States.</p><h3 id="h2_european_leaders_react_to_maduro%E2%80%99s_capture_by_the_us">European leaders react to Maduro’s capture by the US</h3><p>— EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the EU ambassador in Caracas. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”</p><p>— Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for “de-escalation and responsibility.
