    <p>News that DFL Gov.

What happens now?</li></ul></div><p>Here’s an edited sampling of comments from Walz’s political supporters and opponents.</p><h3 id="h3_rep._kristin_robbins%2C_r-maple_grove%2C_chair_of_the_house_fraud_prevention_committee_and_candidate_for_governor">Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, chair of the House Fraud Prevention Committee and candidate for governor</h3><p>“Tim Walz and his staggering fraud could not outrun our investigations and the momentum we have in this race. He knows he will lose in November, and would rather give up than take responsibility. As governor, I will dismantle the years of fraud Democrats allowed and ensure our tax dollars work for Minnesotans.”</p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_dfl_party_chair_richard_carlbom">Minnesota DFL Party Chair Richard Carlbom</h3><p>“We’re grateful for the years Governor Walz has spent in public service delivering for Minnesotans as a public-school teacher, National Guardsman, member of Congress, and as our governor. We respect his decision to not seek a third term. True to form, he is choosing to spend the remainder of his term focused on governing, improving lives, and standing up for Minnesota.”</p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_house_speaker_lisa_demuth%2C_r-cold_spring%2C_and_candidate_for_governor">Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, and candidate for governor</h3><p>“If Democrats think they can sweep Minnesota’s fraud scandal away by swapping out Tim Walz, they are wrong. Every Democrat in Minnesota has spent years enabling criminals who stole our tax dollars, with still no meaningful accountability and no end in sight to the billions in fraud that still plagues nearly every government program imaginable thanks to 16 years of Democrat control.” </p><h3 id="h3_joel_smith%2C_president_of_liuna_minnesota_%26_north_dakota_construction_and_laborers_union">Joel Smith, president of LIUNA Minnesota &amp; North Dakota construction and laborers union</h3><p>“Under Governor Walz’s leadership, Minnesota construction Laborers have logged record work hours for six of the last seven years, that’s because Walz has prioritized fixing Minnesota’s roads, bridges, and water infrastructure, putting Laborers to work. Thank you, Governor Walz.&quot;</p><h3 id="h3_kendall_qualls%2C_republican_candidate_for_governor">Kendall Qualls, Republican candidate for governor</h3><p>“Tim Walz’s two terms as governor have been a total failure for Minnesota as rampant fraud, out-of-control crime, sky-high prices and declining schools are holding Minnesota back. Walz is terrified to run on his record. But it doesn’t matter if the DFL props up Amy Klobuchar or any other candidate, they share Walz’s record of failure and incompetence.”</p><h3 id="h3_dfl_minnesota_attorney_general_keith_ellison">DFL Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison</h3><p>“Tim Walz is a remarkable leader, and Minnesota has benefited immensely from the compassion he brought to his decades of public service. Tim banished hunger from Minnesota classrooms, signed universal background checks into law, and passed paid family leave. He built a record of standing up for people who need it.”</p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_gop_u.s._rep._tom_emmer">Minnesota GOP U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer</h3><p>“Good riddance.”</p><h3 id="h3_mike_newcome%2C_independent_candidate_for_governor">Mike Newcome, independent candidate for governor</h3><p>“It doesn’t matter what name comes after the R or the D, the reason we’re in the situation we’re in is because of generations of political mismanagement of our state and state agencies. Minnesota deserves better. And an independent governor is the only real answer.” </p><h3 id="h3_minneapolis_mayor_jacob_frey">Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey</h3><p>“Because of Governor Walz, Minnesotans have paid family leave and free school meals. We have rights and freedoms that our neighbors don&#x27;t. Thank you, Governor, for everything you have done for our city and our state.”</p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_house_gop_floor_leader_harry_niska">Minnesota House GOP floor leader Harry Niska</h3><p>“Minnesota’s fraud epidemic extends well beyond any one individual. It is the result of nearly two decades of Democrat governors, backed by their legislative allies, creating a culture of complacency that has cost Minnesotans and their families billions of dollars.”</p><h3 id="h3_ken_martin%2C_national_democratic_committee_chair%2C_former_dfl_party_chair">Ken Martin, National Democratic Committee chair, former DFL Party chair</h3><p>“Tim has always believed that leadership isn’t about preserving your own power — it’s about using it to make a difference for as many people as possible. He doesn’t measure success by elections won, but by classrooms strengthened, families supported, and communities that are better off because he fought for them.” </p><h3 id="h3_former_presidential_candidate_and_minnesota_u.s._rep._dean_phillips">Former presidential candidate and Minnesota U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips</h3><p>“I have no intention to run for Minnesota Governor or U.S. Senate. But I stand at the ready to assist common sense candidates committed to reducing the cost of living, improving education and public safety, addressing corruption, and restoring competency in governance.” </p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_gop_party_chair_alex_plechash">Minnesota GOP Party Chair Alex Plechash</h3><p>“Governor Tim Walz leaves behind a legacy Minnesotans won’t soon forget — a legacy of dysfunction, disorder, and declining trust. The choice for voters is clear: more of the same failed Democratic leadership — or real change with Republicans who are ready to restore trust, accountability, and Minnesota’s promise.”</p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_democratic_u.s._sen._tina_smith">Minnesota Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith</h3><p>“Governor Walz’s decision to not seek reelection is what it looks like when leaders put the interests of the people before politics. Tim’s career has been defined by getting results for Minnesotans, doing the right thing, and always putting people first. In the face of an unprecedented and coordinated attack on Minnesota by President Trump and his administration, the governor is once again doing the right thing.” </p><h3 id="h3_minnesota_democratic_u.s._sen._amy_klobuchar%2C_a_possible_candidate_for_governor">Minnesota Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a possible candidate for governor</h3><p>“Governor Walz made the difficult decision to focus on his job and the challenges facing our state rather than campaigning and running for reelection.  He has always dedicated his career to delivering for Minnesota and his impact will be felt for generations to come — from providing school breakfast and lunches to our kids to passing gun safety legislation to maintaining our state’s AAA bond rating. He is a true public servant.”</p><h3 id="h3_former_presidential_candidate_and_vice_president_kamala_harris%2C_walz%E2%80%99s_former_running_mate">Former presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris, Walz’s former running mate</h3><p>“Tim has spent his life in public service putting Minnesotans first, leading with integrity, compassion and a deep respect for working families. His decision not to seek reelection reflects that same selfless commitment to the people he serves. I want to thank him for his extraordinary leadership. Doug and I wish Tim, Gwen and the entire Walz family the very best in their next chapter. Our country is stronger because of Tim’s service, and I am deeply grateful for his friendship.&quot;</p>
