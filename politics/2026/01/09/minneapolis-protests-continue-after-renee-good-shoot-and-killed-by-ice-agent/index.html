But reversed course, saying it has sole authority. </p><p>Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson said that could hamper a state investigation and possible prosecution.</p><p>“Unless we do that thorough investigation, unless we have access to all of that evidence, unless we have access to the agents that were involved in that, to any witnesses, without any of that, we would not be able to put together a quality investigation for any prosecutor to be able to make a determination as to whether or not someone should be charged with a crime,” he said.</p><p>Jacobson and Gov. Tim Walz urged the Trump administration to allow state and local law enforcement officers to participate in the investigation to ensure public trust in its results.</p><p>“Use our professional folks.

It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome” with the FBI solely in charge, he said, adding that President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “have told you things that are verifiably false.”</p><p>Walz said Noem and others have already prejudged the outcome of the investigation. Noem, he added, “was basically judge, jury and executioner&quot; in her comments Wednesday.</p><p>Walz continued to plead for people to protest peacefully, saying the Trump administration was looking for an excuse to bring troops into the region.</p><p>He said he was particularly distressed about federal agents descending on Minneapolis Roosevelt High School Wednesday, saying, “I beg you, implore you to tell them to stay out of our schools.”</p><h3 id="h2_young_students_protest_ice_actions">Young students protest ICE actions</h3><p>Young students marched near Kenny Community School on Thursday in Minneapolis to protest the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent as well as the presence of U.S. Border Patrol agents Wednesday at Minneapolis Roosevelt High School.</p><p>Minneapolis Public Schools are closed for the rest of the week due to safety concerns following the enforcement action.</p><div class="apm-gallery"><div class="apm-gallery_title"> </div><div class="apm-gallery_slides"><div id="slideshow" data-testid="slideshow" class="slideshow"><button aria-haspopup="dialog" data-testid="fullscreen-button" class="slideshow_fullscreen"><svg class="icon icon-fullscreen slideshow_icon slideshow_icon-fullscreen" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M6.987 10.987l-2.931 3.031-2.056-2.429v6.411h6.387l-2.43-2.081 3.030-2.932-2-2zM11.613 2l2.43 2.081-3.030 2.932 2 2 2.931-3.031 2.056 2.429v-6.411h-6.387z"></path></svg><span class="invisible" data-testid="icon-fullscreen">Fullscreen Slideshow</span></button><button data-testid="prev-button" aria-label="Icon Chevron Left" class="slideshow_button slideshow_button-prev"><svg class="icon icon-chevronLeft slideshow_icon" width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M48.2 47.4L30 47.4C28.9 47.4 28 46.5 28 45.4L28 44.3C28 43.2 28.9 42.3 30 42.3L46.2 42.3 46.2 26.1C46.2 25 47.1 24.1 48.2 24.1L49.4 24.1C50.5 24.1 51.4 25 51.4 26.1L51.4 45.4C51.4 46.5 50.5 47.4 49.4 47.4L48.2 47.4Z" fill="#FFFFFF" transform="translate(21, 18) rotate(135) translate(-39.7, -35.8)"></path></g></svg><span class="invisible">Previous Slide</span></button><div class="slideshow_container" aria-modal="false" aria-label="Slideshow container"><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">1 of 2</div></div></div><div class="slideshow_item"><div class="slideshow_slide"><div class="slideshow_count">2 of 2</div></div></div></div><button data-testid="next-button" aria-label="Icon Chevron Right" class="slideshow_button slideshow_button-next"><svg class="icon icon-chevronRight slideshow_icon" width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M39.2 47.4L21 47.4C19.9 47.4 19 46.5 19 45.4L19 44.3C19 43.2 19.9 42.3 21 42.3L37.2 42.3 37.2 26.1C37.2 25 38.1 24.1 39.2 24.1L40.4 24.1C41.5 24.1 42.4 25 42.4 26.1L42.4 45.4C42.4 46.5 41.5 47.4 40.4 47.4L39.2 47.4Z" fill="#FFFFFF" transform="translate(12, 18) rotate(-45) translate(-30.7, -35.8) "></path></g></svg><span class="invisible">Next Slide</span></button><div id="slideshowBg" role="figure" data-testid="slideshowBg" class="slideshow_bg"></div></div></div></div><p><strong><em>— Kerem Yücel, MPR News</em></strong></p><h3 id="h2_10%3A20_a.m._%7C_state_investigators_say_they_are_off_the_case%2C_fbi_solely_in_charge">10:20 a.m. | State investigators say they are off the case, FBI solely in charge</h3><p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension says it’s no longer part of the investigation into the killing of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE agent.</p><p>Authorities on Wednesday said the BCA would be working jointly with the FBI on the investigation.
