    <p>A bill to end a partial government shutdown is nearing final passage in the House after narrowly clearing a critical procedural hurdle Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>A vote on passage is expected soon, which would wrap up congressional work on 11 of the annual appropriations bills that fund the government for the budget year ending Sept. 30. The last bill to be worked out covers the Department of Homeland Security where Democrats are demanding more restrictions on enforcement operations.</p><p>President Donald Trump has said he will sign the bill when it reaches his desk. </p><p>Speaker Mike Johnson needed near-unanimous support from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote. He narrowly got it during a 217-215 vote that was held open for nearly an hour as leaders worked to gain support from a handful of GOP lawmakers who were trying to advance other priorities unrelated to the funding measure.</p><p>"We have to work through individual members’ concerns. That’s the game here. It’s a consensus building operation. We do it every day,” Johnson said.</p><p>Trump had weighed in Monday in a social media post, calling on Republicans to stay united and telling holdouts “There can be NO CHANGES at this time.”</p><p>“We will work together in good faith to address the issues that have been raised, but we cannot have another long, pointless, and destructive Shutdown that will hurt our Country so badly — One that will not benefit Republicans or Democrats. I hope everyone will vote, YES!,” Trump wrote on his social media site.</p><p>The measure would end the partial government shutdown that began Saturday, In addition to funding most of the federal government through Sept. 30, it includes a short-term funding patch for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 13 as lawmakers negotiate potential changes for the agency that enforces the nation's immigration laws — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.</p><p>Running Trump's ‘play call’</p><p>The House had previously approved the final package of spending bills, but the Senate broke up that package so that more negotiations could take place for the Homeland Security funding bill. Democrats are demanding changes in response to events in Minneapolis, where two American citizens were shot and killed by federal agents.</p><p>Johnson said on Fox News Channel's “Fox News Sunday” it was Trump's "play call to do it this way. He had already conceded he wants to turn down the volume, so to speak.” But GOP leaders sounded as if they still had work to do in convincing the rank-and-file to join them as House lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday after a week back in their congressional districts.</p><p>“We always work till the midnight hour to get the votes,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. “You never start the process with everybody on board. You work through it, and you could say that about every major bill we've passed.”</p><p>The funding package passed the Senate on Friday. Trump says he'll sign it immediately if it passes the House. Some Democrats are expected to vote for the final bill but they did not do so for the initial procedural measure setting the terms for the House debate, making it the tougher test for Johnson and the White House.</p><p>Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has made clear that Democrats wouldn't help Republicans out of their procedural jam, even though Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer helped negotiate the funding bill. </p><p>Jeffries, of New York, noted that the procedural vote covers a variety of issues that most Democrats oppose, including resolutions to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.</p><p>“If they have some massive mandate,” Jeffries said of Republicans, “then go pass your rule, which includes toxic bills that we don't support."</p><p>Key differences from the last shutdown</p><p>The path to the current partial shutdown differs from the fall impasse, which affected more agencies and lasted a record 43 days. </p><p>Then, the debate was over extending temporary coronavirus pandemic-era subsidies for those who get health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Democrats were unsuccessful in getting those subsidies included as part of a package to end the shutdown.</p><p>Congress has made important progress since then, passing six of the 12 annual appropriations bills that fund federal agencies and programs. That includes important programs such as nutrition assistance and fully operating national parks and historic sites. They are funded through Sept. 30.</p><p>But the remaining unpassed bills represent roughly three-quarters of federal spending, including the Defense Department. Service members and federal workers could miss paychecks depending upon the length of the current funding lapse. </p><p>Voting bill becomes last-minute obstacle</p><p>Some House Republicans have demanded that the funding package include legislation requiring voters to show proof of citizenship before they are eligible to participate in elections. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., had said the legislation, known as the SAVE Act, must be included in the appropriations package.</p><p>But Luna appeared to drop her objections late Monday, writing on social media that she had spoken with Trump about a "pathway forward" for the voting bill in the Senate that would keep the government open. Luna and Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., met with Trump at the White House.</p><p>The Brennan Center for Justice, a think tank focused on democracy and voting rights issues, said the voting bill's passage would mean that Americans would need to produce a passport or birth certificate to register to vote and that at least 21 million voters lack ready access to those papers.</p><p>“If House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown,” said Schumer, of New York. “Let’s be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters."</p><p>Johnson, of Louisiana, has operated with a thin majority throughout his tenure as speaker. But with Saturday's special election in Texas, the Republican majority stands at a threadbare 218-214, shrinking the GOP's ability to withstand defections.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press video journalist Nathan Ellgren and writers Lisa Mascaro and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report.</p>
