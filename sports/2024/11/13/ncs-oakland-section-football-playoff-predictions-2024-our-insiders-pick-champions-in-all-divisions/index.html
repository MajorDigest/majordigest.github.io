    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The easiest prediction during North Coast Section football playoff season is De La Salle’s division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobody within the section has beaten the Spartans in 33 years, and every time there seems to be a worthy challenger, the Concord powerhouse answers the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathan Canilao said the call won&#8217;t be answered this time, raising eyebrows during our special playoff edition video as he is taking Pittsburg to win this week against Clayton Valley and next week against De La Salle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobody else picked Pittsburg to win the Open title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the rest of us – Darren Sabedra, Joseph Dycus, Christian Babcock, Mike Lefkow – picked the Pirates to rebound from the DLS loss to win the section’s Division I championship in Week 3 of the playoffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other surprise pick belonged to the king of surprise picks among our crew, Dycus, who said Livermore will not only beat Granada on Friday but also will ride off to the Division IV championship as a sixth seed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As always, we make the picks in good fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Be sure to check out the video as the guys explain all of their decisions.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want just the picks, keep scrolling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are the picks:</span></p>
<h3><b>North Coast Section</b></h3>
<h3><b>Open/Division I (Open winner)</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Not much to say here. De La Salle has been the preeminent program in the NCS for decades, and that is not going to change this year. However, this is the first time the Spartans could claim a world championship, seeing as they defeated NFL Academy in London last month.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe this Pittsburg team will go down as one of the most talented teams in the Bay Area. That’s why I’m picking the Pirates to make history and win the Open Division crown over De La Salle. Marley Alcantara, Jamar Searcy and Co. have been dominant all season, averaging just over 46 points per game. Pittsburg’s defense has Division I talent all over the field, from UCLA commits Jewelous Walls and Jadyn Hudson to San Diego State-bound linebacker Etene Pritchard. I think this is the team that will finally break De La Salle’s 33-year unbeaten streak against NCS opponents. </span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Heaven knows I’ve picked against De La Salle plenty of times over the past three years, but not even I can talk myself into anyone but the Green Machine representing NorCal against (probably) Mater Dei in the state Open title game. The Spartans are just too deep, talented and disciplined to be beaten by PIttsburg or any other team in the NCS. </span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> DLS and Pitt are the two best teams in NorCal. The Pirates have college talent up and down their roster, but this DLS team might be the best since Justin Alumbaugh succeeded Bob Ladouceur before the 2013 season. Spartans all the way to State.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> De La Salle has won 31 consecutive NCS championships and is 275-0-1 within the section since its last loss, to Pittsburg in 1991. Given that this is also DLS’s best team in years, give me the Spartans to beat Pittsburg for the Open crown.</span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> De La Salle (Babcock, Lefkow, Sabedra, Dycus). Pittsburg (Canilao).</span></p>
<h3><b>Open/Division I (D-I winner)</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Pittsburg is built for a D-I title, and I think the Pirates get it this year. But watch out for San Ramon Valley. SRV is lurking just outside the top 30 teams in the state and has the best player on the field in Marco Jones. A D-I final between those two teams would be must-see entertainment.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If I’m right on Pittsburg, De La Salle will drop down to Division I, where it will annihilate the competition. I wouldn’t want any part of the Spartans after an upset loss and I expect De La Salle to cruise in the Division I final.</span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pittsburg may not be able to get past De La Salle, but the Pirates’ consolation prize will be a fourth consecutive D-I championship. The defense has two UCLA commits and the passing attack is without peer in the Bay Area, so this is an easy choice. </span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Is there a team that could stun Pittsburg in this division? San Ramon Valley would have the best shot. Nobody’s stopping Pitt.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pittsburg will bounce back from the loss to De La Salle to win the Division I title and advance to a NorCal regional. The Pirates will then win a regional title and cap the Marley Alcantara era at QB with the program’s first state championship.</span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pittsburg (Babcock, Lefkow, Sabedra, Dycus). De La Salle (Canilao).</span></p>
<h3><b>Division II</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">When in doubt, look at the quarterbacks. I see the two best QBs in this division as Liberty’s Sage Robertson and AV’s Tristian Tia, and I think their teams match up for the D-II title. And in that game, I see the Dons emerging with the win. Tia is a bona fide star at the position, and AV has picked up multiple clutch victories this year. But I’m not counting out Robertson – any QB who throws six touchdown passes in a game is more than capable of willing his team to a championship.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Amador Valley has the best quarterback in the Bay Area and the Dons can put up 40 points in their sleep. If seeds hold, the Dons will play Liberty in the section title game – a team that beat them earlier in the season. But I don’t see Tia and the Amador Valley offense being denied a second time. Give me the Dons. </span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was skeptical of Bishop O’Dowd to start the year, but that doubt is no more. Hardy Nickerson has turned the Dragons into a truly formidable team capable of grinding down defenses with their diverse running game. And when the Oakland school needs to make a play through the air, Washington commit Deji Ajose will come through. </span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> A final between top seeds Liberty and Amador Valley is marquee. Amador Valley is especially impressive right now. The Dons are 4-2 in their last six games, with a one-point loss to San Ramon Valley and an overtime defeat to California. Playing the hot hand: Amador Valley.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> This bracket could have a great final between the top two seeds, No. 1 Liberty and No. 2 Amador Valley. When they met in September, Liberty won 34-28. If there is a rematch, and I think there will be, Amador and its star QB Tristan Tia will prevail. Give me the Dons.</span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amador Valley (Babcock, Lefkow, Sabedra, Canilao). Bishop O’Dowd (Dycus).</span></p>
<h3><b>Division III</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This division is a tough nut to crack. I’m tempted to go with Northgate, which has exceeded expectations all season long. Northgate wasn’t expected to beat Las Lomas, but the Broncos routed their Walnut Creek rivals at home and then went on to win the outright DAL Valley title. But top seed Acalanes will be extra motivated after losing its shot at ending a 43-year outright league title drought in the regular-season finale against Las Lomas. The Dons also have the advantage of playing two potential home games, and that could make a difference in getting them over the top. </span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Playoff Campolindo is real and I think the Cougars are licking their chops to see Acalanes in a potential section title game after losing an emotional rivalry game a few weeks ago. Campolindo has been up and down, but I think the Cougars are finally putting it together. </span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Assuming Acalanes is at full strength, the Dons are the biggest and fastest team in the bracket, especially on the defensive line with Bethel Imasuen and Deonte Littlejohn. And on top of that, the Lafayette school also has championship experience. What’s not to like?</span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Much will depend on the health of Acalanes QB Tyler Winkles. He missed last Friday’s game against Las Lomas and the Dons lost. Winkles will be a game-time decision, said coach Floyd Burnsed. If he can’t go, the division becomes more even. We’ll bet he plays and Acalanes wins.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Acalanes QB Tyler Winkles missed last week’s regular-season finale, and the Dons sputtered in a loss to Las Lomas. Assuming he returns from injury, Acalanes should have what it takes to win another section crown and advance to the regionals. Give me Acalanes. </span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Acalanes (Babcock, Lefkow, Sabedra, Dycus). Campolindo (Canilao).</span></p>
<h3><b>Division IV</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Ukiah might be too good for any of the local teams in this bracket. Granada, if it gets past Livermore, might have something to say about that. But the Matadors would likely have to go on the road in the second round, and I’m not sure I see them getting past both American Canyon and Ukiah.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I think this division is a toss up, but I’m going with American Canyon. The Wolves started the year with eight consecutive wins, and though they lost their last two games, they are still a dangerous team. Ukiah will give them a run for their money in the championship game, but I’m leaning toward American Canyon to win its first section title in school history. </span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> In a bracket that looks as wide open as this division, why not pick No. 6 seed Livermore to go all the way? With an elite running back like Kamarri Robinson headlining the offense, the Cowboys have the talent to shock the world.</span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> With Granada, Antioch, Redwood and Livermore seeded three through six, you think NCS could’ve avoided Livermore and Granada playing on back-to-back Fridays. Neither school has played Antioch or Redwood this season. Also, because of an NCS rule that league champs get a first-round home game if possible, No. 1 seed Ukiah will travel over 100 miles to visit No. 8 seed Alameda. So who wins this division? Our bus stops at American Canyon.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Ukiah is the top seed. It has a 2,000-yard passer at QB (Beau David) and a 700-yard rusher at RB (Christopher Thompson). That could be enough to give the Wildcats their first NCS title since 1999. Give me Ukiah. </span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Ukiah (Babcock, Sabedra). American Canyon (Lefkow, Canilao). Livermore (Dycus).</span></p>
<h3><b>Division V</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">St. Vincent de Paul is the heavy favorite in this division – Calpreps has it rated almost 100 spots ahead of No. 2 Salesian. That’s probably too much for the Pride to make up, but they should be able to give the top seed a competitive game and maybe even a scare.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Salesian has something brewing this season. The Pride finished the regular season 9-1 and have talent all over the field. I’m banking on wide receiver Carlton Perrilliat to have a monster run through the playoffs. If seeds hold, Salesian will get a rematch with North Bay power St. Vincent de Paul – the team that beat the Pride by 36 points in last year’s section title game. I’m feeling Salesian in an upset. </span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> St. Vincent de Paul captured the NCS Division VI title last season, defeating Salesian  48-12. I think the teams will meet again in the title game, and while I expect the Pride to put up more of a fight, the Mustangs from Petaluma should be able to repeat. </span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Last season St. Vincent de Paul and Salesian met for the D-VI title. The Petaluma school won 48-12. This year St. Vincent and Salesian are seeded one-two in D-V. Should they meet again, the Mustangs will be favored, but not by 36 points. Both teams are 9-1. Sonoma Valley (10-0) is the biggest threat to sideline one of the favorites. We’ll go with St. Vincent to win.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Make no mistake. Salesian has had a great season, beating everyone on its schedule except El Cerrito. But unfortunately for the Pride, the team that routed them in the NCS Division VI final 48-12 last season (St. Vincent de Paul) is in this bracket, too. Give me St. Vincent. </span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> St. Vincent de Paul (Babcock, Lefkow, Sabedra, Dycus) Salesian (Canilao).</span></p>
<h3><b>Division VI</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">What an intriguing mix of teams. In a bracket with no obvious favorite, give me Miramonte. The Matadors have been battle-tested in the DAL Foothill, and this field gives them a golden opportunity to end their season on a high note.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Miramonte is the most battle-tested team in this bracket. Quarterback Carson Blair has been excellent this season and I believe he’ll lead the Matadors to a section title.</span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> A Miramonte team that just doesn’t quite have the depth to compete in the DAL Foothill gets put into a lower bracket, and then wins it all? It’s deja vu all over again. Miramonte’s offense has too many athletes and too much talent to be stopped by any D-VI opponent.</span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Miramonte is the second seed, but the Matadors beating top seed Arcata wouldn’t surprise. However, this could be a long bus ride for Miramonte if both teams get to the title game, giving Arcata a definite home-field edge. Tigers win the division.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Miramonte (4-6) limps into the playoffs on a four-game losing streak. But the opponents in the DAL Foothill are stronger than what the Mats will see in the NCS Division VI bracket. Miramonte won NCS Division V last season. The Mats will take D-VI this time.</span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Miramonte (Babcock, Sabedra, Canilao, Dycus). Arcata (Lefkow).</span></p>
<h3><b>Division VII</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I see this division as pretty close to a coin flip between Piedmont and Moreau Catholic. I’m leaning Piedmont’s direction just a little bit. Since opening the season with a loss to D-V No. 2 seed Salesian, Piedmont has won each of its final nine games by at least 21 points. It looks to me like the Highlanders have figured out exactly how to win, and I’m giving them the edge over Moreau.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back-and-forth between Moreau Catholic and Piedmont, but I’m going with the Mariners to win Division VII. Moreau has played good teams all season and boasts an offense that includes quarterback Jeremiah Charles, wide receiver Jalen Arnold and running back Jayden Bryant – all players who will receive all-league honors.</span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Piedmont has spent the past nine weeks running roughshod over the middle of the WACC. It could’ve been argued that Piedmont belongs in D-V. Can any team in Division VII keep up with speedster Sam Shelby, dual-threat Markos Lagios or linebacker Cash Elmquist? I doubt it. </span></p>

<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> It’s Moreau Catholic, Piedmont and a bunch of schools up north. A Piedmont-Moreau final would be attractive for those in Alameda County, but the Highlanders would likely have to travel 250 miles to play Ferndale in the semifinals before playing Moreau. Mariners win this division.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Piedmont has been a great story, going 9-1 and getting seeded third in D-VII. But top-seeded Moreau Catholic has played stronger competition and had a much tighter game with Salesian than Piedmont did. No. 2 seed Ferndale could also pose a threat, but give me Moreau.</span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Moreau Catholic (Lefkow, Sabedra, Canilao). Piedmont (Babcock,, Dycus).</span></p>
<h3><b>Oakland Section</b></h3>
<p><b>Babcock: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Mack today, Mack tomorrow and twice on Friday nights. McClymonds is the best team in the Oakland Section, has been, will be, and I see nothing changing that this postseason.</span></p>
<p><b>Canilao: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll keep my answer short. No one is beating McClymonds. </span></p>
<p><b>Dycus:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> McClymonds – even with a few players still suspended as punishment for their role in a fight against Fremont-Oakland – shut out Oakland Tech, the second-best team in the league. Expect more of the same in the Silver Bowl as Mack rolls to yet another section title. </span></p>
<p><b>Lefkow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> McClymonds hasn’t lost to an Oakland Athletic League opponent on the field since Oakland Tech beat the Warriors on Nov. 21, 2009. Oakland Section an easy call: McClymonds.</span></p>
<p><b>Sabedra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> McClymonds has barely broken a sweat against its Oakland Athletic League competition for years. While this season has included a forfeit in OAL play for Mack, that will not play a factor in the Silver Bowl. Give me Mack, big once again.</span></p>
<p><b>Final tally:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> McClymonds (Babcock, Lefkow, Sabedra, Canilao, Dycus).</span></p>
