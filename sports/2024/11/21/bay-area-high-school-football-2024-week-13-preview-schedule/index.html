<h3><b>Central Coast Section</b></h3>
<h3><b>Open/Division I</b></h3>
<p><b>Open final</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 2 St. Francis (9-2) vs. No. 1 St. Ignatius (9-2) at San Jose City College, Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Division I semifinal</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 5 Los Gatos (9-2) at No. 3 Riordan (7-4), Saturday, 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Next week’s Division I final</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Los Gatos-Riordan winner vs. St. Francis-St. Ignatius loser, TBA</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Plenty of intrigue abounds in this bracket. The Open final is a rematch of a zany regular-season game where </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/18/tale-of-two-halves-st-francis-comes-out-of-halftime-locker-room-scores-27-unanswered-to-beat-st-ignatius/"><span style="font-weight: 400">St. Ignatius led 13-0 at the half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> only to lose 27-13 at home in San Francisco. Though the Wildcats are the high seed in the matchup, this game will be played much closer to Mountain View. </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/16/ccs-ncs-football-playoffs-st-ignatius-pittsburg-menlo-san-leandro-campolindo-piedmont-hills-branham-advance/"><span style="font-weight: 400">SI put forth a dominant showing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the opening round of the Open/D-I playoffs, routing eighth-seeded Salinas 45-7. </span><b>Jarious Hogan </b><span style="font-weight: 400">rushed for two touchdowns, giving him 23 this season. SI also scored two defensive TDs. St. Francis will lean on superstar running back </span><b>Kingston Keanaaina</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who ran for two touchdowns and 219 yards last week. He rushed for 218 yards in the second half alone when the Lancers beat SI. Riordan is red-hot, most recently </span><a href="https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2024/11/17/soquel-crushed-by-archbishop-riordan-in-first-round-of-open-d-i-playoffs-ccs-football/"><span style="font-weight: 400">scorching Soquel 41-7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the opening round of the Division I tournament. Washington-committed wide receiver </span><b>Chris Lawson </b><span style="font-weight: 400">caught four touchdown passes from </span><b>Mike Mitchell Jr. </b><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/16/los-gatos-beats-serra-hands-padres-first-ccs-loss-since-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Los Gatos upset Serra on the road</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the first time in 10 years, but it may take a truly generational effort for the Cats to win this one. Senior quarterback </span><b>Scotty Brennan</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who played well against Serra, might need to produce the game of his life. If Los Gatos can establish the run with </span><b>Grayson Doslak </b><span style="font-weight: 400">as it did late against Serra, the Wildcats may have a chance. But Riordan – perhaps the most talented high school team in the South Bay and Peninsula – is absolutely rolling right now. Plus, the San Francisco school no doubt has not forgotten losing at Los Gatos in the first round of last season’s CCS playoffs. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400" data-rich-links="{&quot;per_n&quot;:&quot;Christian Babcock&quot;,&quot;per_e&quot;:&quot;cbabcock@bayareanewsgroup.com&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;person&quot;}">Christian Babcock</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division II</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 7 Palma (6-5) vs. No. 6 Menlo (8-3) at Sequoia HS, Saturday, 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Menlo-Atherton (7-4) at No. 1 Wilcox (9-2), Friday, 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This division may be more open than expected after Wilcox quarterback </span><b>Kai Imahara</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> injured his shoulder the last time Wilcox played M-A just two weeks ago. The Chargers had no issue with Santa Teresa in the first round, but the Bears present a different test. After Imahara got hurt, M-A staged a comeback and tied the game 21-21. Running back </span><b>Brayden Rosa’s </b><span style="font-weight: 400">late touchdown helped Wilcox seal the win at home. Rosa and senior backup </span><b>Adrian Garcia </b><span style="font-weight: 400">will likely split time at quarterback. Wilcox coach Paul Rosa noted that he hoped the Chargers would have a smoother operation after two weeks of practice with Garcia and Rosa at the controls. Rosa should get the ball a minimum of 10-20 times whether he is lined up under center or at running back. </span><b>Xander Eschelman</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who threw three touchdown passes in M-A’s 35-7 win over Monterey, will lead the Bears’ offense. Palma upset No. 2 Sacred Heart Cathedral last week and should provide a tough test for Menlo, which went on the road to beat Christopher in the opening round. This game was moved to Sequoia High School in anticipation of heavy rain affecting Menlo’s grass field at home. We’ll see if the weather affects the performance of Menlo quarterback </span><b>Jack Freehill, </b><span style="font-weight: 400">who completed 10 of 17 passes for 200 yards, two touchdowns and an interception against Christopher. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400" data-rich-links="{&quot;per_n&quot;:&quot;Christian Babcock&quot;,&quot;per_e&quot;:&quot;cbabcock@bayareanewsgroup.com&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;person&quot;}">Christian Babcock</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division III</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 7 Aptos (6-5) at No. 3 Palo Alto (6-5), Friday, 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Hollister (5-6) at No. 1 Carmel (11-0), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Palo Alto will be back on its home field for a semifinal game on Friday against Aptos after rallying to defeat Half Moon Bay 33-24 in the first round. The win was the Vikings’ seventh in a row in CCS play dating to 2022. Two years ago, Palo Alto won three games to capture the Division V crown. Last year, the Vikings hoisted the Division IV trophy after winning three more games. To make it three section titles in a row – and seven overall for the program – Palo Alto will have to beat an Aptos team that outlasted second-seeded Willow Glen 47-35 last week behind a rushing attack that amassed 424 yards in 43 attempts (9.9 yards per carry). If the Vikings survive, they’ll have to beat another team from the southern end of the section next week in the final. </span><b>Isaiah Phillips</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> carried a heavy load for Palo Alto in Round 1, rushing for 175 and two touchdowns in 14 carries. Sophomore </span><b>Justin Fung </b><span style="font-weight: 400">added 105 yards passing and a touchdown. To get past Aptos, Palo Alto will likely need another productive game from defenders such as </span><b>Joseph Kessler</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Roman Jacobs</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Each had 16 tackles last week. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Darren Sabedra</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division IV</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 3 Sacred Heart Prep (5-6) at No. 2 Branham (8-3), Friday, 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Burlingame (7-4) at No. 1 Piedmont Hills (9-2), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The most intriguing game in this bracket is at Branham, where the Bruins will have the opportunity to face a Peninsula Athletic League Bay Division team for a shot at section title glory. Branham had no trouble scoring in its opening-round game against North Monterey County, winning 50-21. </span><b>Jack Lewis </b><span style="font-weight: 400">tossed three touchdown passes and </span><b>Michael Murphy </b><span style="font-weight: 400">ran for three TDs. Sacred Heart Prep had a difficult season in the PAL Bay, but the D-IV tournament has offered them a shot at redemption. The Gators beat King’s Academy 24-14 in the first round behind 134 rushing yards from </span><b>Greg Gamitian, </b><span style="font-weight: 400">85 from </span><b>Maxime Morelle </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and 80 by </span><b>Kyle Chai. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">SHP attempted one pass the entire game. On the other side of the ledger, Piedmont Hills welcomes in a Burlingame team that notably beat Wilcox 19-18 on the road. The Pirates did just enough to get past Live Oak in the first round, winning 10-6 thanks to a touchdown run from </span><b>Gage Jones</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and a 25-yard field goal by </span><b>Zach Pallach. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Burlingame outlasted North Salinas 17-14, holding on after building up a 10-0 halftime lead. </span><b>Lucas Kirk </b><span style="font-weight: 400">sealed it for Burlingame with a late rushing TD, while </span><b>Hayden Haba</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> ran in a first-half score. </span><b>Luke Dimech </b><span style="font-weight: 400">kicked a 38-yard first-half field goal to help the Panthers fortify their early advantage. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400" data-rich-links="{&quot;per_n&quot;:&quot;Christian Babcock&quot;,&quot;per_e&quot;:&quot;cbabcock@bayareanewsgroup.com&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;person&quot;}">Christian Babcock</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division V</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 3 Leland (8-3) at No. 2 Alisal (6-5), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Sequoia (6-5) at No. 1 South San Francisco (9-2), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">South San Francisco, aiming for its second consecutive CCS Division V title, started its title defense last week with a 28-7 victory over Gunderson. The Warriors run an old-school T-formation offense that runs on almost every down. </span><b>Marcus Mercurio</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Elijah Fields </b><span style="font-weight: 400">are the top ball-carriers, and they’ll need to make plays to get past red-hot Sequoia. The Ravens have won six of seven since losing their first four games. Their offense is led by running back </span><b>Jordan Crockett IV</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and quarterback </span><b>Shawn Royer</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, while </span><b>Mario Fausto </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and the defense shut down previously-undefeated Gunn in a first-round game. Leland advanced with a 30-20 victory over Stevenson. Alisal edged Overfelt 20-16. Leland’s offense is defined by a diverse rushing attack that has had nine players rush for a touchdown this season. </span><b>Jacob Gibson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has run for a team-high nine TDs, and </span><b>Hudson Vye </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><b>Brady Hernandez </b><span style="font-weight: 400">have both run for over 500 yards. </span><b>Javien Louie</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Caden Canter </b><span style="font-weight: 400">have intercepted four passes apiece for the Chargers’ defense.  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Joseph Dycus</span></i></p>
<h3><b>North Coast Section</b></h3>
<h3><b>Open/Division I</b></h3>
<p><b>Open final</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 2 Pittsburg (10-1) vs. No. 1 De La Salle (11-0) at Diablo Valley College, Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Division I semifinal</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 5 Cardinal Newman (10-1) at No. 3 San Ramon Valley (10-1), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Next week’s Division I final</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cardinal Newman-San Ramon Valley winner vs. Pittsburg-De La Salle loser, TBA</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Pittsburg will try to end De La Salle’s three-plus-decade unbeaten streak within the section when the heavyweights meet for the Open Division title. DLS is 276-0-1 against NCS teams since losing to Pittsburg in a section final in 1991. Pirates coach </span><b>Charlie Ramirez</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a sophomore linebacker on that Pittsburg team. De La Salle is aiming for its 32nd consecutive NCS title.  Last week, the Spartans routed San Marin and Pittsburg beat Clayton Valley Charter. The winner Friday will advance to the state playoffs. The loser will play the San Ramon Valley-Cardinal Newman winner next week for the Division I title and state berth. This will mark the first meeting between Pittsburg and DLS since the Concord school won 30-23 in the 2022 Open final. This year’s DLS team is the program&#8217;s best in years. QB </span><b>Toa Faavae</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, a sprinter on the track team, leads a rushing attack that averages 281 yards per game. The Spartans also rely on standout RBs </span><b>Derrick Blanche</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>Dominic Kelley</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Duece Jones-Drew</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. DLS’s defense, with lineman </span><b>Matt Johnson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and DB </span><b>Jaden Jefferson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> among its stars, will be tested by QB </span><b>Marley Alcantara</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the Pitt passing game. Big-play backs </span><b>Jamar Searcy</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Elijah Bow</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> are the perfect complement to the air-raid, and UCLA-bound defenders </span><b>Jadyn Hudson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>JuJu Walls</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> have the talent to put a dent in the DLS veer-option offense. If Pittsburg loses to DLS for the 34th consecutive time, the Pirates will have to bounce back for a game next week. San Ramon Valley faced Pittsburg in last season’s D-I final after the Danville school lost to DLS in the Open title game. SRV will have its hands full against Cardinal Newman, even with the Bay Area’s best player on defense, </span><b>Marco Jones</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, on its side. The Texas A&amp;M commit has 106 tackles, 29 TFL and 9.5 sacks. Cal Poly commit </span><b>Kaleb Pleis </b><span style="font-weight: 400">has 13.5 sacks. </span><b>Rhett Thompson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> – a recent Bryant commit – has thrown for 34 touchdowns. Cardinal Newman’s top offensive player is running back </span><b>Jamari Gentry</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who has scored a team-high 12 touchdowns. The Cardinals’ only loss was against the same Marin Catholic team the Santa Rosa school defeated in the first round last week. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Joseph Dycus</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division II</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 3 Windsor (8-3) at No. 2 Amador Valley (7-4), Friday, 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Bishop O’Dowd (9-2) at No. 1 Liberty (8-3), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Can anyone stop </span><b>Tristan Tia</b><span style="font-weight: 400">? The Amador Valley quarterback threw for four touchdowns and ran for another in the Dons’ 42-21 win over Las Lomas last week. The Oregon State commit has built a strong connection with </span><b>Anthony Harrington</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, throwing seven touchdowns to the wide receiver in the last three games. Expect Windsor to present a big challenge. The Jaguars have three losses this season, to Cardinal Newman, San Marin and Marin Catholic – all teams that were selected to the NCS Open/Division I bracket. Windsor lost those games by a total of 12 points. Calpreps has Windsor winning 31-28. In the top half of the bracket, top-seeded Liberty will host red-hot Bishop O’Dowd, which has won its last seven games. O’Dowd eked out a 31-28 win over Monte Vista in overtime at home last week behind three touchdown passes from quarterback </span><b>Devin Wilson</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. O’Dowd has weapons all over its offense with wide receiver </span><b>Deji Ajose</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and running backs </span><b>Saliou Sow</b><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><b> Elliott Lewis</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Oc Lehner</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Look for Liberty to keep the ball on the ground behind star running back </span><b>Jaxon Bell</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Monte Vista running back Julian McMahon ran for a school-record 307 yards against O’Dowd last week. To keep the defense honest, Liberty can also gain yards through the air. Quarterback </span><b>Sage Robertson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> threw for two touchdowns in a 35-7 win over Vintage last week. Calpreps picks Liberty to win 31-22. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division III</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 6 San Leandro (6-5) at No. 2 Campolindo (6-5), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Heritage (7-4) at No. 1 Acalanes (8-3), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Not many gave San Leandro a shot last week to upset a scorching-hot Northgate team, but that’s exactly what the Pirates did. Their running game was firing on all cylinders, with </span><b>Jaymieon Bradley</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> rushing for 195 yards and two touchdowns. San Leandro will be underdogs once again against a Campolindo team that looks to be putting it all together at the right time. The Cougars have a running game that is lethal, too, with junior </span><b>Micah Parker</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and senior </span><b>Blaise Clancy</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The two combined for 174 yards and four touchdowns in a 45-7 win over Berkeley last week. … Acalanes is one win from its second consecutive NCS final. QB </span><b>Tyler Winkles</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> returned last week after missing the Dons’ regular-season finale with an injury and completed 7 of 9 passes for 157 yards and three touchdowns in a 42-13 win over Dublin. Heritage also got back its quarterback last week, </span><b>Phillip Babbitt</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who threw for 125 yards and a touchdown in a 34-0 win over James Logan. Calpreps favors Acalanes 28-14. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division IV</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 3 Granada (7-4) at No. 2 American Canyon (9-2), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 5  Redwood (7-4) at No. 1 Ukiah (8-3), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Preview: After beating Livermore at home in back-to-back weeks, Granada will face a new opponent on the road for a spot in next week’s final. The Matadors’ versatile offense has been clicking since the start of league play. Running back </span><b>Estevan Duarte</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a bruising runner who also is a threat in the passing game. Quarterback </span><b>Jack Badger</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> can do it all as a true dual-threat. He has plenty of options in the passing game with wide receivers</span><b> Damien Miles</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Peyton Richards</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the perimeter. American Canyon had a dominant start to the season, but has slowed a bit lately. The Wolves dropped their final two regular-season games, to Casa Grande and Redwood, and barely squeaked by College Park at home 7-0 last week. Junior running back </span><b>Andre Lopez</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has been American Canyon’s star player as he has totaled 19 touchdowns and is averaging 137 yards per game. Granada has not won a section title since 1995. Calpreps projects a 26-21 Granada win. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division V</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 3 Sonoma Valley (11-0) at No. 2 Salesian (11-0), Saturday, 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Maria Carrillo (8-3) at No. 1 St. Vincent de Paul (10-1), Saturday, 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If anyone says they saw a semifinal matchup between Salesian and Sonoma Valley happening, don’t believe them. Sonoma Valley is one of the region’s surprise teams, having completely turned around its program after 10 consecutive losing seasons. In the past five seasons – counting the abbreviated spring 2021 COVID season – Sonoma Valley won 10 games total. The Dragons topped that number in one season this fall, winning their 11th game last week with a 49-12 rout of Hayward. Salesian is more an NCS small-school blue blood, winning seven section titles in program history, all since 2010. The Pride has lost only once on the field this season, 28-7 to El Cerrito, but that result was later changed to a forfeit win for  Salesian. The Pride has won four in a row since the El Cerrito game, including a 42-18 victory over Mt. Diablo in the first round of NCS last week. Salesian has gotten it done behind a balanced attack, with QB </span><b>Marcus Burke </b><span style="font-weight: 400">passing for around 2,000 yards and a running game led by</span><b> Isaiah Latigue</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> accounting for about the same total. Basketball standout </span><b>Carlton Perrilliat</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who measures 6-5, has more than 1,000 receiving yards for the Pride. If Salesian advances, top-seeded St. Vincent de Paul is the likely opponent in the final. St. Vincent beat Salesian 48-12 in the Division VI title game last season.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – Darren Sabedra</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Division VI</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 6 Benicia (5-6) at No. 2 Miramonte (5-6), Friday, 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 5 Petaluma (5-6) at No. 1 Arcata (10-1) at McKinleyville HS, Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>

<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The four teams standing in this bracket have captured 11 NCS titles between them. Miramonte has won 10 of them. The Mats remain under .500 on the season, but don’t let that fool you. They sharpened themselves in the rugged Diablo Athletic League Foothill Division, losing to the likes of Acalanes, Clayton Valley and Campolindo. They’ll face another DAL team in the semifinals, albeit one from the league’s middle-tier division, the Valley. When Benicia visited Miramonte for a non-league game in September, the home team breezed to a 52-7 rout as </span><b>Carson Blair</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> passed for 334 yards and four touchdowns. </span><b>Jack Quinnild</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> was on the receiving end of all four scores that night, finishing with seven catches for 187 yards. In his team’s opening-round 43-23 victory over Newark Memorial last week, Blair threw for 286 yards and three TDs. His top targets were </span><b>David Roman</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (four catches, 133 yards, one TD) and Quinnild (five receptions, 106 yards, one TD). Benicia advanced with a 42-38 victory over third-seeded Piner. Top-seeded Arcata had the bracket’s most dominant first-round victory, rolling over Bethel 52-12. Petaluma, which won its only NCS title in 1977, reached the semifinals with a 39-33 win over Montgomery-Santa Rosa.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – Darren Sabedra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Division VII</b></h3>
<p><b>Semifinals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 3 Piedmont (10-1) at No. 2 Ferndale (10-1), Saturday, 1 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. 4 Del Norte (9-2) at No. 1 Moreau Catholic (7-4), Friday, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Having shut down its program in the middle of the 2022 season because of low numbers, Piedmont is now one victory away from playing for a section championship. The East Bay school last won an NCS title in 1976. To move a step closer to the trophy, the explosive Highlanders will need to make a 270-mile trip to Ferndale. Dual-threat Piedmont QB </span><b>Markos Lagios</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has thrown for 2,136 yards and 25 TDs while also running for 13 scores. Power back </span><b>Tommy Ashton</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has run for 17 touchdowns, and WR </span><b>Sam Shelby</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> stretches the field with 1,157 yards and 10 touchdowns. </span><b>Xavier Henderson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Brandon Dicke</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> are both playmakers in the secondary. While the Highlanders have to travel this week, their possible championship opponent, top-seeded Moreau Catholic, will play host to a Del Norte team making a long trip from Crescent City. Moreau WR </span><b>Jalen Arnold</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, RB </span><b>Jayden Bryant</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and athlete </span><b>Peyton Collins</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> have all accounted for double-digit touchdowns. The Mariners finished second in the WACC Foothill Division and have scored at least 30 points in four of their last five games. The Mariners aren’t all offense as </span><b>Seth Evans</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Eriq Fields</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> both have more than 90 tackles this season. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Joseph Dycus</span></i></p>
<h3><b>Oakland Section</b></h3>
<p><b>Silver Bowl</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oakland (8-3) vs. McClymonds (7-4) at Castlemont HS, Saturday, noon</span></p>
<p><b>Preview: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">McClymonds, which beat Oakland 60-6 during the regular season, is a heavy favorite as it competes for its 15th consecutive Silver Bowl championship. QB </span><b>Berell Staples </b><span style="font-weight: 400">has provided a passing element to a McClymonds offense that had been one-dimensional in recent years. </span><b>Sharky Tamale</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Dominic Davis</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> remain a potent one-two punch at RB, and </span><b>Rahsjon Duncan </b><span style="font-weight: 400">is a future Division I player at cornerback. McClymonds’ only loss in league play came via forfeit after several players were suspended for their involvement in a mid-game fight. Oakland isn’t on Mack’s level, but that shouldn’t take away from what coach </span><b>Terry Hendrix</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has done since taking over the program last season. He inherited a team that had not won a game in three years, led it to a 5-5 finish last season and the Silver Bowl in Year Two. </span><b>Yasser Jackson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a two-way standout, </span><b>Lenox Colvin </b><span style="font-weight: 400">has a lively arm at QB and </span><b>Ymer Belvine</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the team’s top offensive weapon. The Wildcats upset favored Oakland Tech 10-7 in the semifinals, winning on a walk-off field goal by </span><b>Noah Bandabaila</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Joseph Dycus</span></i></p>
