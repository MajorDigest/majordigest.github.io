    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212;  Jake Moody missed another goal attempt in Week 17, setting social media and talk radio ablaze.</p>
<p>Time for the 49ers to get a new kicker, or at the very least some competition during training camp in 2025.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, even if coach Kyle Shanahan threw his tablet on the sidelines in frustration after Moody missed a 41-yard attempt in a 29-17 loss to the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we&#8217;ve got the right guy,&#8221; Shanahan said Thursday as the 49ers (6-9) began preparations to host the Detroit Lions (13-2). &#8220;He&#8217;s showed that at times. I thought he showed that at times in his rookie year. I thought he showed that in being 12 of 13 to start the year and I think he&#8217;ll show that in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>But rest assured that Moody will be watched closely to see how he performs in the final two weeks of the season, beginning with a spotlight game on Monday night in a rematch of last year&#8217;s NFC Championship Game won 34-31 by the 49ers.</p>
<p>Since the game is at Levi&#8217;s Stadium, Moody should enter with some confidence. He&#8217;s 23-for-30 on field goal attempts a 76.7 rate that&#8217;s unacceptable in today&#8217;s NFL, let alone for a kicker who was selected in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft. But all seven of his misses have been on the road &#8212; one in Miami, two in Buffalo in the snow, three in Tampa Bay in the sunshine and one in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Which apparently came as news to Moody.</p>
<p>&#8220;I actually didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221; Moody said. &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty interesting. I don&#8217;t think that necessarily has anything to do with it, being home or away. It&#8217;s just the misses, I&#8217;ve got to hit better kicks. It&#8217;s not any specific reason why I miss. I&#8217;ve just got to make sure I&#8217;m dialed in on my form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moody is 15-for-15 in field goal attempts at home, starting off 6-for-6 in the opener against the New York Jets. But Moody sustained a high ankle sprain on his right kicking foot in Week 5 against Arizona, missing three games as the 49ers cycled through Matthew Wright (also injured on a kick return) and Anders Carlson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since he&#8217;s come back, he hasn&#8217;t been as consistent, obviously,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;I think a lot of it probably has to do with (the injury), just common-sense wise. Hopefully he can get to this offseason, heal up and find a stroke again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having a midseason injury was a &#8220;learning experience,&#8221; according to Moody.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether or not that was an issue, I don’t know. I’m still doing the best I can trying to keep everything what it was prior to the injury,&#8221; Moody said. &#8220;It’s not like you can really blame something.&#8221;</p>
<p>While tempted to alter his approach and preparation, Moody thought better of it. He considers kicking similar to golf, and said it can take years for golfers to master a swing change.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this business you don&#8217;t have that much time to try and dial something in and do big changes like that,&#8221; Moody said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be consistent and not be changing too many things or you&#8217;ll be overwhelmed by everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the 49ers may bring another kicker into camp just for an extra leg, Shanahan didn&#8217;t sound as if he was looking to set up a competition for No. 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you’ve got the wrong guy if you have to,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;You do that when you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to have a guy, but when those guys miss too much you go get a new one usually. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s tough about the kicker position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shanahan hinted strongly Monday that linebacker Dre Greenlaw wouldn&#8217;t play in the last two games, saying he&#8217;d wait until talking to him before making it official.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not going to play in these two games,&#8221; Shanahan said Thursday. &#8220;He understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Left tackle Spencer Burford (calf) did not practice and Shanahan thought there was a chance he&#8217;d be ready to face Detroit with Trent Williams and Jaylon Moore both on injured reserve. Left guard Aaron Banks (knee), who hasn&#8217;t yet been placed on IR, did not practice and neither did edge rusher Robert Beal Jr.</p>
<p>Those who were limited were safety Ji&#8217;Ayir Brown (ankle), running back Isaac Guerendo (foot/ankle). Nick Bosa (hip/oblique) was off the injury list.</p>
<p>Veteran offensive lineman Matt Hennessey was added to the roster with Williams going on injured reserve, with Sebastian Gutierrez joining the practice squad.</p>
<p>Shanahan will try to piecemeal an offensive line heading into Detroit, with newcomer Charlie Heck also in the mix.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to mix and match a number of guys,&#8221; Shanahan said.</p>
<p>The 49ers activated the practice clock on rookie linebacker Tatum Bethune, who has been out with a knee injury in hopes of getting him back before the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Detroit Dan Campbell thinks last year&#8217;s loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game helped prepare them for taking another run at this season.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re really more mature,&#8221; Campbell told the Detroit media. &#8220;Every year you learn something about winning and losing. And when you take an `L&#8217; like we did last year you learn from that . . . I think we&#8217;re much more prepared than at that time. You feel like you&#8217;re (prepared) but you get into that with a heavyweight that&#8217;s been there numerous times, you don&#8217;t always know. I think that as an experience has served us well moving into this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lions have also taken notice of what happened to the 49ers in 2022 when Brock Purdy tore the UCL in his throwing elbow in the NFC title game against Philadelphia and didn&#8217;t have a viable quarterback. Veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater was signed to the roster, giving the Lions three quarterbacks along with starter Jared Goff and backup Hendon Hooker.</p>

<p>&#8212; Tight end George Kittle (68 receptions, 967 yards) needs 33 yards receiving to reach 1,000 for the fourth time in his career and second in succession. With eight touchdown receptions, he&#8217;s three shy of his career high of 11 set in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8212; Wide receiver Jauan Jennings (63 receptions, 856 yards) needs 144 yards in his last two games to reach 1,000 for the first time in his career. His six touchdown receptions are a career best.</p>

<p>&#8212; Bosa has has seven sacks and needs three over the last two games for his fourth consecutive season in double figures. Bosa had 15 1/2 in 2021, 18 1/2 in 2022 (winning NFC Defensive Player of the Year) and 10 1/2 last season.</p>
<p>First, Bosa is thinking about his eighth sack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just trying to get to the next one,&#8221; Bosa said. &#8220;But it would be cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212; Defensive end Leonard Floyd has 8 1/2 sacks and needs 1 1/2 over the last two games to reach double figures for the second consecutive season and for the fourth time in his career.</p>
<p>&#8212; Middle linebacker Fred Warner (117 tackles) needs 21 in his last two games to exceed his career high of 137 in 2021. Warner has exceeded 100 tackles in each of his seven seasons.</p>
<p>&#8212; Purdy has 31 rushing first downs, three more than Colin Kaepernick had in 2013 and 2014.</p>
