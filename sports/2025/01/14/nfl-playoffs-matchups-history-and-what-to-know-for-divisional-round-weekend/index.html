<p>As the Bears' search for a new head coach intensifies — and seemingly now includes every candidate out there (see our Coaching Tracker) — there are still eight teams left in the NFL playoffs.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is where the Bears hope their new coach will take them one day, and beyond.</p>



<p>Here's a look at the NFL Divisional Round matchups, as eight teams remain in the quest to hold the Lombardi Trophy as the winner of Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, Feb. 9, in New Orleans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">NFC</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Washington Commanders (12-5) at Detroit Lions (15-2)</h3>



<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, 7 p.m., Fox</p>



<p><strong>Playoff seeds:</strong> Washington No. 6, Detroit No. 1</p>



<p><strong>Last week:</strong> Washington won at Tampa Bay, 23-20, in the Wild Card Round; Detroit had a bye.</p>



<p><strong>Early line:</strong> Detroit -9.5 (per ESPN Bet, subject to change)</p>



<p><strong>Last matchup:</strong> The Lions and Commanders did not play each other this season or last season. Their last meeting came in Week 2 of the 2022 season, a 36-27 Lions victory in Detroit.</p>



<p><strong>Commanders Super Bowl history:</strong> Washington has reached the Super Bowl five times, winning three of them: XVII, XXII and XXVI. The Commanders were one of the NFL's premier teams in the 1980s and early 1990s, winning it all under legendary coach Joe Gibbs in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons. But they have not been back to the Super Bowl since that last title. Their win this past Sunday night, in fact, was their first playoff win of any kind since Jan. 7, 2006.</p>



<p><strong>Lions Super Bowl history:</strong> Detroit has never even reached a Super Bowl in its long history, and this is probably the best chance the Lions have ever had. They rolled through the regular season as the NFC's juggernaut, winning the NFC North and earning the conference's No. 1 seed, which came with a first-round bye and home-field advantage. The Lions' last NFL title came in 1957, nearly a decade before the first Super Bowl was played.</p>



<p><strong>The storyline: </strong>This is a game between two NFL franchises with lots of history and rabid fanbases that have been yearning for a winner for a long, long time. Whoever wins will keep taking their fans to euphoric heights. The Commanders hope they can return to the glory days of the Joe Gibbs era under quarterback Jayden Daniels, who's having a spectacular rookie season. The Lions and their long-suffering fans, meanwhile, are two wins away from their first-ever trip to the Super Bowl.</p>



<p>Detroit came within a whisker last season, watching a lead evaporate in a painful loss to the 49ers in San Francisco in the NFC Championship Game. A win Saturday would put the Lions back in that spot, this time playing in front of a raucous home crowd at Ford Field.</p>



<p>Washington's last trip to the NFC Championship Game was 23 years ago, at the end of the 1991 season. And it was against the same team the Commanders play on Saturday. On Jan. 12, 1992, Washington routed Detroit, 41-10, in Washington to advance to Super Bowl XXVI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Los Angeles Rams (10-7) at Philadelphia Eagles (14-3)</h3>



<p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, 2 p.m., NBC/Peacock</p>



<p><strong>Playoff seeds:</strong> Los Angeles No. 4, Philadelphia No. 2</p>



<p><strong>Last week:</strong> Los Angeles beat Minnesota, 27-9, in the Wild Card Round, game was moved to Glendale, Ariz., due to Los Angeles wildfires; Philadelphia won at home over Green Bay, 22-10, in the Wild Card Round.</p>



<p><strong>Early line:</strong> Philadelphia -6 (per ESPN Bet, subject to change)</p>



<p><strong>Last matchup:</strong> The teams played each other less than two months ago, on Nov. 24 in Los Angeles. The Eagles raced out to a 20-7 lead on their way to a 37-20 win in Week 12.</p>



<p><strong>Rams Super Bowl history:</strong> Los Angeles has played in five Super Bowls, three when the franchise has been in Los Angeles and two when it was in St. Louis. The Rams have won two of those Super Bowls, XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis and LVI after they moved back to Los Angeles. That one was three years ago to conclude the 2021 season.</p>



<p><strong>Eagles Super Bowl history:</strong> Philadelphia has played in four Super Bowls, with their lone title coming in LII to cap the 2017 season. The Eagles will be trying to reach their second Super Bowl in three years after losing to the Kansas City Chiefs on a last-second field goal in LVII to end the 2022 season.</p>



<p><strong>The storyline:</strong> Whatever happens on the field, all is dwarfed by the Los Angeles wildfires that are causing death and destruction right now. There's nothing that can be done on a football field to make that better, but the Rams are surely playing with some extra emotion and trying to give LA-area residents something to cheer about. They did just that by thumping the Vikings on Monday night in a game moved to Arizona.</p>



<p>On the field, this is a game between two of the hottest teams in football. The Rams got off to a terrible start this season, going 1-4 prior to their bye week. But they've won nine of 12 since then, capturing the NFC West title and continuing their roll through the first round of the playoffs.</p>



<p>The Eagles, meanwhile, started their season 2-2 but have won 12 of 13 since, including Sunday's playoff win over the Packers. Philadelphia's only loss since early in the season came when starting quarterback Jalen Hurts was knocked out of the game early. Speaking of Hurts, he's the Eagles' big question mark. Their defense may be the best in the NFL, but Hurts struggled in his return against the Packers and hasn't looked too sharp of late.</p>



<p>These teams have also been the class of the NFC in recent years, combining for four of the conference's seven titles (two apiece) since the start of the 2017 season.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AFC</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Houston Texans (10-7) at Kansas City Chiefs (15-2)</h3>



<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, 3:30 p.m., ESPN/ABC/ESPN+</p>



<p><strong>Playoff seeds:</strong> Houston No. 4, Kansas City No. 1</p>



<p><strong>Last week:</strong> Houston won at home over Los Angeles Chargers, 32-12, in the Wild Card Round; Kansas City had a bye.</p>



<p><strong>Early line:</strong> Kansas City -8 (per ESPN Bet, subject to change)</p>



<p><strong>Last matchup:</strong> The teams played less than a month ago, in a Week 16 matchup on Dec. 21. That was also on a Saturday afternoon in Kansas City, and the Chiefs held on for a 27-19 victory.</p>



<p><strong>Texans Super Bowl history:</strong> Houston has never played in a Super Bowl, although the franchise has only been around since 2002.</p>



<p><strong>Chiefs Super Bowl history:</strong> Kansas City has become synonymous with the Super Bowl in recent years, reaching the AFC Championship Game six seasons in a row and the Super Bowl in four of those seasons. The franchise is 4-2 in all-time Super Bowl appearances, winning IV, LIV, LVII and LVIII.</p>



<p><strong>The storyline:</strong> This is all about NFL history.</p>



<p>The Chiefs are three wins away from accomplishing something no team has ever done: win three straight Super Bowls. The New England Patriots were the last team to reach it three straight years in a row, from 2017-19, but they lost the second of those.</p>



<p>The 1965-67 Packers remain the only team ever to win three consecutive NFL titles in the playoff era. However, the first of those was the last season before the Super Bowl came into existence.</p>



<p>The Texans are definitely the forgotten team in this matchup. Many pundits ranked them as the worst team in the playoff field after they got in by winning the weak AFC South, but they looked good in their Wild Card blowout of the Chargers, intercepting Justin Herbert four times to advance to the Divisional Round for the second straight season.</p>



<p>Houston has never reached an AFC Championship Game in franchise history. But the Texans were very close in the 2019 season, losing a game that provides some historical context to this matchup. On Jan. 12, 2020, the Texans led the Chiefs, 24-0, early in the second quarter in a Divisional Round game at Arrowhead Stadium. But the Chiefs roared back in stunning fashion, scoring 51 of the game's next 58 points en route to a 51-31 victory on the way to their first Super Bowl title in 50 years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Baltimore Ravens (12-5) at Buffalo Bills (13-4)</h3>



<p><strong>When: </strong>Sunday, 5:30 p.m., CBS/Paramount+</p>



<p><strong>Playoff seeds:</strong> Baltimore No. 3, Buffalo No. 2</p>



<p><strong>Last week:</strong> Baltimore won at home over Pittsburgh, 28-14, in the Wild Card Round; Buffalo won at home over Denver, 31-7, in the Wild Card Round.</p>



<p><strong>Early line:</strong> Baltimore -1 (per ESPN Bet, subject to change)</p>



<p><strong>Last matchup:</strong> The teams met way back in Week 4, on Sept. 29 in Baltimore. The Ravens rolled to a 35-10 win, racking up 271 rushing yards and 427 total yards. Derrick Henry rushed for 199 yards and a score.</p>



<p><strong>Ravens Super Bowl history:</strong> The Ravens have been to two Super Bowls and won them both, XXXV and XLVII. Last season, they were in prime position to make a third trip to the Super Bowl, with the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage in the AFC playoffs. But they suffered a bitter 17-10 loss to the Chiefs in the conference title game and are now one win away from getting back there, with a chance to avenge that defeat.</p>



<p><strong>Bills Super Bowl history:</strong> All NFL fans know this tragic tale. In the early 1990s, the Bills became the first team ever to reach four Super Bowls in a row. And they lost them all. Their tortured history has come back in recent years, with Buffalo losing the AFC title game to the Chiefs following the 2020 season and falling in the Divisional Round each of the last three years. Will this be the season the Bills finally get back to the Super Bowl and win it all?</p>



<p><strong>The storyline:</strong> This is the final game of Divisional Round weekend, and it's also the most anticipated.</p>



<p>This game has it all: Two possible MVP quarterbacks in Baltimore's Lamar Jackson and Buffalo's Josh Allen; two teams regarded by most as the best in the NFL, along with — or aside from — the Lions, Eagles and Chiefs; and two teams trying to exorcise recent playoff demons.</p>



<p>And for the Bills, a whole franchise history full of playoff demons.</p>



<p>The only thing bad about this game is that it's not for the AFC title. One of these teams won't get the chance to play for it.</p>
