    <p>Nico Collins is always a marked man when the Texans break the offensive huddle and he lines up across from much smaller cornerbacks he towers above.</p><p>At 6-foot-4, 222 pounds with 4.4 speed in the 40-yard dash, outstanding strength, leaping ability, precise routes, and crisp hands, Collins represents the prototype of the modern NFL wide receiver.</p><p><b>RELATED: </b>How Nico Collins has reasserted himself as Texans’ most dangerous downfield weapon: ‘Nobody has worked harder than Nico’</p><p>The Texans’ $75 million man and Pro Bowl selection is a focal point of their passing game. He’s also the center of attention for opposing defenses’ coverage schemes.</p><p>As good as Collins has been, setting a franchise playoff record with 122 receiving yards to surpass DeAndre Hopkins’ statistical mark as he finished with seven catches on eight targets and one touchdown in an AFC wild-card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, the former University of Michigan standout needs help from his teammates.</p><p>Especially in an AFC divisional round playoff game Saturday against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium where defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo figures to have standout cornerback Trent McDuffie assigned to Collins a lot and tilt over former Texans safety Justin Reid to apply help over the top on the Texans’ best wide receiver.</p><p><b>SEE ALSO:</b> Broken-play brilliance, timely scramble by C.J. Stroud spark Texans, beat Chargers: ‘Play of the game’</p><p>While Collins delivered a stellar performance and quarterback C.J. Stroud broke out of a funk with 282 passing yards, the Texans didn’t have a bankable complementary presence opposite him.  Wide receiver John Metchie III fumbled away his first touch and finished with four catches for 28 yards on eight targets. Tight end Cade Stover, now out for the season with a broken collarbone that will require surgery, caught all four passes thrown to him for 28 yards. Veteran tight end Dalton Schultz signed to a three-year, $36 million deal in the offseason, had two catches for 23 yards.</p><p>And wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson delivered arguably the biggest play of the game on his lone reception and target, a 34-yard catch off an electric broken play engineered by Stroud after he fumbled a shotgun snap.</p><p>“Very proud of Nico for what he’s been able to accomplish just all year, everything that he’s done, even when everyone knows the ball is going to him, he still makes the play,” Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. “So, excited for him and just his trajectory as a pro and he’s done an outstanding job this entire year. And when it comes to other guys around him, for us, it’s just about how we need to move the football to gain yards. Whoever is tasked with getting the ball, just want guys to protect the ball and press forward. It really doesn’t matter if you get it, do your best with the football.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#Texans coach DeMeco Ryans on individual ability of Pro Bowl wide receiver Nico Collins @lbg_nico7 and a need for other receivers to complement him and take care of the football @KPRC2 pic.twitter.com/MXeuAgk56J</p>&mdash; Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) January 13, 2025</blockquote><p>While Collins surpassed Hopkins’ franchise playoff receiving yardage -- Hopkins had 118 yards in a 2019 divisional round loss to the Kansas City Chiefs -- the Texans didn’t get a lot of consistency from the other downfield targets.</p><p>Running back Joe Mixon was thrown to twice and had one catch for 13 yards. He arguably should be involved more in the passing game.</p><p>“I think he is a really good receiver,” Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik said. “We worked it a lot in camp, I am sure all you guys saw that. We did a good amount of it in camp. We did some of it early in the year. I think as the year has gone, we have probably gotten away from that a little bit. We wanted to make sure he was fresh for some of his carries but without a question that is something that is on my mind. How do we make use of a guy who we think is an excellent player?”</p><p>Collins caught seven passes for 60 yards on 10  targets in the first game against the Chiefs.</p><p>With Tank Dell and Stefon Diggs out for the season with knee injuries and wide receiver Diontae Johnson cut from the team at his request, per league sources, after expressing his displeasure at not being involved more against the Chargers and needing to be calmed down afterward by team captains Mixon and Azeez Al-Shaair, the receiving corps is in flux. Robert Woods has missed two practices this week with a hip injury. He caught two passes for 22 yards on four targets against Kansas City.</p><p>“I was really proud of our entire receiver group in that last game,” Slowik said. “That game really exemplified perseverance and character on offense. I think Nico leads that. He is just an incredibly humble human, incredibly talented human and he gets the most our of his talent. He does not let any of it go to waste. He works incredibly hard and dedicates all the time he can, helps other when he can.</p><p>“It is evident a lot of guys are trying to take him away within our concepts and he is still finding ways to get open,” Slowik added. “He is still finding ways to make plays. I was equally proud of our other receivers and what they were doing around him. C.J. had options on where he could go with the ball. It wasn’t just a one-man show, and it wasn’t just Dalton. We did feel really good about where we got as an entire unit and what he can do.”</p><p>Despite missing five games with a pulled hamstring and spending four weeks on injured reserve before being designated for return and getting back on the field against the Dallas Cowboys, Collins managed to catch 68 passes for 1,006 yards and seven touchdowns.</p><p>Before his leg injury, Collins was on a torrid pace to finish the season with over 100 catches and 2,000 receiving yards.</p><p>Since his return, Collins has resumed his role as the Texans’ go-to guy on offense.</p><p>“Nico, like I told you, was born out the womb great,” Stroud said. “Nobody knew it but his pops and his mom. That dude right there, he’s really elevated himself as an NFL No. 1 receiver. He shows that week in and week out. I’m just so happy for that guy.</p><p>“I think this is just the start for him as well. Another 1000-yard season. He’s still hungry for more and he’s in here every day working on his body. I know he’s hungrier than ever. I’m happy for him. Super blessed to be a part of his journey. He’s another brother of mine.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/S2vdWwNxwp <br>Here&#39;s #Texans wide receiver Nico Collins&#39; touchdown @KPRC2</p>&mdash; Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) January 11, 2025</blockquote><p>MORE TEXANS COVERAGE</p><ul><li>‘True playmaker’ Nico Collins squares off against Colts after dominant performance in pivotal game last season</li><li>Mindset of Texans’ Nico Collins, the NFL receiving yardage leader: ‘The guy in front of you can’t stop me’</li><li>How ‘dynamic’ Texans RB Joe Mixon joined Arian Foster, Jim Brown, Emmitt Smith in statistical benchmarks in epic season</li><li>Source: Texans signing guard Tremayne Anchrum Jr. to practice squad</li><li>Texans designate corner Jeff Okudah, defensive end Jerry Hughes for return from injured reserve</li><li>Source: Texans worked out linemen La’el Collins, Tremayne Anchrum Jr, Ike Boettger, Jerome Carvin, DB Jason Taylor</li><li>Texans rookie Jamal Hill honored by official proclamation in Georgia hometown</li><li>Texans’ Kenyon Green dislocated left shoulder, to be placed on IR, Kendrick Green steps in, Will Anderson Jr. ankle hurt</li><li>‘I know I have to step up, I know I have shoes to fill,’ Texans’ Tank Dell in spotlight after Stefon Diggs’ torn ACL</li><li>Texans Pro Bowl defensive end Will Anderson Jr. is the AFC Defensive Player of the Month</li><li>‘I’m just trying to be that light as much as I can,’ Texans nickel Jalen Pitre nabs first interception since rookie year</li></ul><p><i>Aaron Wilson is a Texans and NFL reporter for KPRC 2 and </i><a href="http://click2houston.com/" target="_blank"><i>click2houston.com</i></a></p>
