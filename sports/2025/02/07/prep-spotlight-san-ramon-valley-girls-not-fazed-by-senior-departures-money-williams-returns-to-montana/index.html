<p><b>SAN RAMON VALLEY: NEW FACES, SAME STANDARD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">San Ramon Valley has been one of the surprise girls basketball teams of the season, a somewhat puzzling mantle to bequeath a program that reached the NorCal Open Division playoffs in 2024 and has been a contender for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Wolves entered this season having graduated all five starters from last year’s East Bay Athletic League championship squad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there was ever a year for SRV to fall off, this was it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobody told the Wolves that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There was someone who has been writing about sports for, since probably Moses was around, who said that Danville has no talent pool, and that San Ramon Valley would go through a dry spell,” said 2024 Bay Area News Group coach of the year John Cristiano. “I’ve always reminded the girls of that. They said we don’t have any talent here, so let’s go show what we’ve got.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cristiano said that even with all of the new faces, he wanted to go for a “shock and awe” non-league schedule that included the likes of Pinewood, Oakland Tech, St. Mary’s-Stockton and Acalanes to test his young team that has no seniors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">San Ramon Valley survived the gauntlet and is 22-3, a perfect 9-0 in league play and is expected to be a lock to play in the North Coast Section’s elite Open Division bracket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So how’d they do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cristiano’s program only has only one transfer … but she just so happened to be the best hooper in town. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Junior wing Alyssa Rudd transferred from crosstown rival Monte Vista after averaging over 20 points per game for the Mustangs. While she enjoyed her time at Monte Vista, Rudd was willing to move schools and sit out most of December for a chance to play for a proven winner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a pretty difficult decision,” Rudd said. “But it’s definitely a step up, and it&#8217;s what I needed. To be in practice with these girls, we’re all growing together and I’m learning every day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That still leaves four other starting spots, though, plus reserves. Those spots were filled by a mixture of last year’s backups, incoming freshmen and JV players being promoted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sophomores Ella Gunderson and Hania Bowes were backups last season, contributing in spot minutes for San Ramon Valley and learning lessons on one of the best girls basketball teams in the East Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This year, they have stood out in larger roles for a team that has championship aspirations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That experience was eye-opening,” said Bowes, the younger sister of current Cal freshman Sofia Bowes. &#8220;It was great for our development overall, because it was a level we had never played at before. Having minutes with the seniors, it was an amazing experience.”</span></p>

<p><b>OAKLAND: MONEY WILLIAMS BACK AFTER TRAGEDY</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oakland alum Money Williams has been a key player for Montana after</span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/24/former-oakland-high-standout-leaves-college-basketball-team-to-take-care-of-siblings-following-parents-death/"><span style="font-weight: 400"> briefly leaving school in October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> following the death of his mother, Latoya Bailey, to take care of his younger siblings. Williams’ father died during his freshman year, leaving the children with no guardian. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At a recent game against Fremont-Oakland, Wildcats coach Orlando Watkins had high praise for Williams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m so proud to have coached him and for him to still be doing what he’s doing,” Watkins said. “For him to be doing that after all he’s lost over the last year, it&#8217;s a testament to who he is as a person and what his parents instilled in him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Williams is averaging 12.3 points per game as a sophomore and has started 20 of 23 games for one of the top teams in the Big Sky Conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Williams set up a GoFundMe for his family and has raised over $144,000 thus far. </span><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/xb3cs-support-the-williams-family-after-tragic-loss"><span style="font-weight: 400">You can donate here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Joseph Dycus</span></i></p>
<p><b>SANTA TERESA: CASEY CARR SHARES HELMET TRADITION WITH WEDEMEYER TEAMMATES</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the Charlie Wedemeyer All-Star Football Game, every player wears a different helmet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seems self-evident. But these helmets are unlike any others you’ll see under the Friday Night Lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a tradition dating back generations, players from both teams swap helmet stickers for their teams before the game, resulting in some truly unusual looks on the field. Though players wear traditional team helmets from their home school, it’s not uncommon to see those lids plastered with double-digit decals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone brings stickers out, and you just kind of trade stickers,” Santa Teresa kicker Casey Carr, a member of the South team, said. “Really just trade stickers for whatever you want. Some people don&#8217;t want stickers. Some people want every sticker. Some people only want some stickers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Carr picked up logos from Live Oak, Piedmont Hills, Milpitas, Pioneer, Christopher, Leland and Bellarmine. He added one from Colorado State, where he is committed to play college football.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s an extension of the camaraderie Wedemeyer game players develop over the two weeks of practices they share together. Rivals become friends, and those friendships can extend off the field and past the end of their high school careers.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400">These other guys, they feel like family to me,” Carr said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve only been practicing for two weeks, but one time after practice last week, on Friday, I hung out with some of the Willow Glen kids because they were just so funny in practice. So I thought I should hang out with them. But all these guys, they&#8217;re my family too. I feel like I&#8217;ve known them for four years.”</span></p>
<p><em><i><span style="font-weight: 400">–</span></i> Christian Babcock</em></p>
<p><b>DUBLIN: JUNIOR CENTER HAS UNLIMITED POTENTIAL </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cameron Anderson has quietly been one of the best players in the East Bay Athletic League. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 6-foot-7 Dublin center has tormented teams with his high rebounding motor and soft touch around the rim. His ability to take over a game as an inside presence has caught the eye of EBAL coaches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cam Anderson is MVP-caliber next season,” San Ramon Valley coach Brian Botteen said after beating Dublin on Tuesday night. “I don’t think he knows how good he is, and when he figures it out, we’re in trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley coach Mike Hansen added, “I think Cam’s a really good player. He’s a legit center, which you don’t often see at the high school level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Dublin’s first game of the season, Anderson totaled 16 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Gaels over Sacramento powerhouse Destiny Christian. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s getting better and better,” Dublin coach Tom Costello said. “He has no idea how good he can be. His ceiling is really high.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<p><b>BISHOP O’DOWD: JIMMY BUTLER TRADE SHOCKS DRAGONS</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As O’Dowd players waited patiently for their game to start, their phones started to buzz with frequency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before the Dragons’ 7 p.m. tipoff, word of the Golden State Warriors’ blockbuster trade for Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler was making its way through social media. The Warriors acquired the disgruntled six-time All-Star in a package that sent Andrew Wiggins and Kyle Anderson to Miami, Dennis Schröder to Utah and Lindy Waters III to Detroit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And like many Golden State fans, O’Dowd players were relieved that the Warriors found their second star to pair with future Hall of Famer Stephen Curry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was just crazy,” O’Dowd sharpshooter Josh Green said. “I wasn’t really feeling Dennis Schröder. We had to get him out of here. But that trade was crazy.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<p><b>CHRISTOPHER: JAXEN ROBINSON NOT GIVING UP ON QB DREAM</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jaxen Robinson has been a standout quarterback at Christopher for three seasons and was arguably the best one on the field during the 2025 edition of the Wedemeyer All-Star Game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So would it surprise you that he’s not planning to play the position in college?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Robinson, a three-star prospect according to 247Sports, has signed with Northern Arizona, but the Lumberjacks are initially looking at him as a tight end. So how does he feel about the potential of a position switch?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Robinson can help it, he’s still going to be a QB at the next level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In my mind, yeah, definitely,” Robinson said. “If they ever have some depth issues or run into something, I&#8217;m always going to be there. I&#8217;m always going to be a quarterback.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Robinson got at least one more chance to be the signal-caller last Saturday, and he made it count. On a fourth-quarter pass play to Christopher teammate Matthew Boles, Robinson completed a 56-yard deep shot to salt away the South team’s 22-6 win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is my last high school football game, so I&#8217;ve got to make the most of it,” Robinson said.  “Me and my boy Matthew Boles, my outside receiver, I knew I was going to try to get him one more shot. And I did, and it connected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Robinson never attempts a pass in a college game, that was certainly a good one to go out on. </span></p>
