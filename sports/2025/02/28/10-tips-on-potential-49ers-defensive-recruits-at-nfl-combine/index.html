    <p>Defensive linemen were first up at this week’s NFL scouting combine, and that position group is arguably the top priority for the 49ers’ draft sleuths.</p>
<p>The 49ers did not draft a defensive lineman last year, and they’ve selected only two (Robert Beal, Kalia Davis) since the first-round selections of Nick Bosa (2019) and Javon Kinlaw (2020).</p>
<p>Not only must the 49ers replenish the defensive front’s rotation for Robert Saleh’s return as defensive coordinator, they must also add potential starters and depth at linebacker, cornerback and safety in this year’s potential 10-man draft class.</p>
<p>The 49ers&#8217; top pick is slated for No. 11 overall. Perhaps Penn State defensive end Abdul Carter falls to them because of a foot injury. If not, here is what other defenders are saying and how they&#8217;re performing at the combine, with help via the Pro Football Writers of America’s transcripts and the NFL’s stat keepers in Indianapolis:</p>

<p>The 49ers, especially defensive line coach Kris Kocurek, covet a defensive lineman’s get-off speed. Thus, 40-yard dash times may not be as weighted as the 10-yard split or other drills. Robert Beal Jr., a 2023 fifth-round pick, had the 10th-fastest 40-yard time (4.48 seconds) among defensive linemen at the combine since 2003; he has one sack in 187 defensive snaps the past two seasons.</p>
<p>Defensive linemen with the best 10-yard splits and 40-yard times on Thursday: James Pearce Jr. (1.56 seconds, 4.47 seconds; Tennessee), Shemar Stewart (1.58, 4.59; Texas A&amp;M), and, Fadil Diggs (1.60, 4.57; Syracuse).</p>
<p>Boston College’s Donovan Ezeiruaku didn’t run the 40 but did lead the way in the 3-cone drill (6.94 seconds) and 20-yard shuttle (4.19 seconds).</p>

<p>If the 49ers bid adieu to Dre Greenlaw in free agency next month, perhaps a similar linebacker is available with Chris Paul of Ole Miss. “Dre Greenlaw is somebody I get compared to a lot,” Paul said. “We both have similar body frames, someone who plays the game very passionate and very physical, and both play at a high pace.”</p>
<p>Paul is 6-foot-1, 222 pounds; Greenlaw is 6-foot, 230 pounds. A year ago, Greenlaw sustained a torn Achilles in the Super Bowl, then essentially played just two-plus quarters last season in a short-lived comeback.</p>
<p>“He’s somebody I watched ever since he’s been with the 49ers,” Paul said. “I also watched him a bit when he was with Arkansas as that was somebody I got compared to a lot there. But just paying attention to the way he plays the game shows how important the linebacker position is.” Paul added that he’s also studied 49ers star Fred Warner’s leadership style.</p>

<p>Defensive tackle Walter Nolen grew up in Tennessee and Mississippi as a 49ers fan, specifically of linebackers Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman. But it’s former Rams star Aaron Donald who Nolen compares himself to with “his violence and how fast he gets off the ball. His motor. I feel like I’ll bring some of those same things to whatever team I go to.”</p>

<p>Malakai Starks, a Georgia safety and potential first-round pick, said something that could be music to the ears of 49ers GM John Lynch, a Pro Football Hall of Fame safety: &#8220;People don&#8217;t look at (safeties) all the time how they should. It&#8217;s an awesome position. I think it&#8217;s the best position you can play. You just get to go out there and compete. I just love it.”</p>
<p>Starks has studied Kyle Hamilton (Ravens) and Budda Baker (Cardinals) in terms of their play-making ability as roving safeties. “that&#8217;s the biggest thing: being able to produce,” Starks said.</p>

<p>When the 2019 49ers reached the Super Bowl, Saleh wore rubber bracelets inscribed with acronyms of his mottos, including one that read “E.V.” for extreme violence. He’ll appreciate what Maryland defensive tackle Jordan Phillips said about football.</p>
<p>“Playing the game of football, you have to be violent because if not you’re going to get dominated. That’s the reality of it. Especially playing defensive line, you must be violent. It’s something that Maryland and Tennessee and even my high school emphasized. The defenses I’ve always played in have always emphasized violence at the point of attack.”</p>

<p>Back in 1994, the 49ers wisely spent their first-round pick on Bryant Young (Pro Football Hall of Fame, Class of 2022). Could Howard Cross finally be the next Notre Dame defensive tackle they draft? “I’m a nerd, so I look at it like Superman and Batman,” Cross said. “Batman doesn’t have a lot of powers, he doesn’t do a lot of stuff, but he knows how to get around people. I’m a film guru. I sit down and I’ll watch film for an extremely long period of time, maybe even longer than I should, but I look and read and do everything I can to make sure I do everything I can to beat you.”</p>
<p>P.S. The 49ers haven’t drafted a Notre Dame quarterback since Joe Montana in 1979’s third round. Riley Leonard is an option this year, and Notre Dame tight end Mitchell Evans said of him: “He&#8217;s a Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen kind of guy where he can do everything. It&#8217;s going to be kind hard to game plan against him. On top, he&#8217;s just a freak athlete, so good luck stopping him.”</p>

<p>Linebacker Teddye Buchanan, a Palo Alto native and St. Ignatius High-San Francisco graduate, honed his craft in transferring from UC Davis to Cal for his final season (114 tackles, two forced fumbles). “One of my favorite players right now is Fred Warner,” Buchanan said. “Being from the Bay, just the way he plays the game, I think that just really stands out to me. He&#8217;s the best linebacker in the league.” Buchanan said his greatest strengths are sideline-to-sideline speed that helps him track down faster running backs on the perimeter. Yeah, Warner does that, too.</p>
<p>Alabama’s Jihaad Campbell drew comparisons to Warner in terms of height (6-foot-2 7/8; 6-foot-3 3/8), weight (235 pounds; 236), arm length (32.5 inches; 32 inches) and 40-yard dash (4.52 seconds; 4.64).</p>
<p>South Carolina linebacker Demetrius Knight said of potentially joining the 49ers&#8217; linebacker corps: &#8220;It would be an honor to play with those guys. It would be an honor to pick their brains every day to get nuggets from them, to truly immerse myself in the linebacker position to learn everything from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>LSU cornerback Zy Alexander said he’s met with the 49ers, who figure to start Deommodore Lenoir and 2024 second-round pick Renardo Green if Charvarius Ward leaves in free agency. Alexander is a former high school quarterback who had a 2023 ACL tear. “My people back home are 49ers fans, so that made them excited,” said Alexander, of Loreauville, La.</p>


<p>Toledo’s Darius Alexander (6-4, 305 pounds) does not want to be typcast into a defensive tackle role, and that could play into the 49ers’ search for versatile linemen. “I play everything on the D-line. I don&#8217;t play just one spot,” Alexander said. “I&#8217;m a game wrecker and I just love to show my skill off.” He compares favorably to ex-49ers defensive tackle and pending free agent D.J. Jones in the 10-yard split (1.72 seconds vs. 1.76).</p>

<p>Mason Graham, an All-American out of Michigan, listed a current 49ers among his top-five defensive tackles in the NFL: Javon Hargrave, as part of a quintet with Jalen Carter, Kenny Clark, Chris Jones, and, Kobe Turner. Hargrave, the 49ers’ prized free agent two years ago, is expected to be released next month in a cost-cutting move, so Graham could be tasked to fill his shoes.</p>
<p>Graham’s self-described scouting report: “Just how hard I work, no off the field stuff, all about business. No one&#8217;s really concerned about that. But I&#8217;m not a mysterious guy. You don&#8217;t need to look deep into me to find out about me. Everything&#8217;s out there. Nothing to hide.”</p>
