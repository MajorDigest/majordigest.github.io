<p>The final weekend of the 2024-25 high school boys basketball season in Illinois has arrived, as the Super Sixteen has been whittled down to the Final Four.</p>



<p>Now, 10 Chicagoland programs will be among the 16 teams playing for state championships among four classes at the Illinois High School Association State Tournament from Thursday through Saturday at the State Farm Center in Champaign, home of the University of Illinois Fighting Illini.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

<p>Those teams advanced out of Monday's super-sectionals, in which 16 teams in each of the four classes — dubbed the Super Sixteen — played for a trip to the State Tournament.</p>



<p>That leaves 16 teams left overall making the trip to Champaign, four in each class. The state semifinals begin Thursday morning, with all four state championship games scheduled for Saturday this year, concluding with the Class 4A final — IHSA's largest class — at 8 p.m.</p>



<p>All State Tournament games will be streamed on NFHS Network. Visit IHSA.org for ticketing and more information.</p>



<p>Here's a closer look at the 10 Chicagoland teams competing in Champaign this weekend, which includes all four teams in the Class 4A field, three in the Class 3A field, two in the Class 2A field and one in the Class 1A field (info from IHSA.org and other sources):</p>
