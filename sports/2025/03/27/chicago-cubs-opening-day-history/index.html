<p>CHICAGO — Opening Day is finally upon us.</p>



<p>It's a day that comes with a sense of hope among baseball fans in early spring, a season that represents new beginnings often exemplified by the warmer temperatures and the blooming of trees and flowers.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>For one day and one day only, everyone is tied in the standings and on an equal playing field, regardless of roster and ownership — unless you're the Cubs, who are currently 0-2 after losing back-to-back games against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Tokyo to officially open the season in mid-March, only for both teams to return to the U.S. and play a few more spring training games.</p>



<p>At any rate, while that type of scheduling feels inapposite, it doesn't diminish the fact that Thursday is officially Opening Day, a day where oftentimes children ask their parents if they can stay home rather than go to school, with some lucky enough to have their parents oblige and, for the extra lucky, take them to the game.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>The Cubs will "reopen" their 2025 season on the road late Thursday, at 9:10 p.m. against the Diamondbacks in Arizona. It's one of three night games scheduled on Opening Day around MLB.</p>



<p>Here's a look at how the Cubs have fared historically on Opening Day and a roundup of some of the most memorable season openers for the North Siders:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Do the Cubs have a winning record on Opening Day?</h3>



<p>According to MLB.com, the Cubs have an Opening Day record of 81-67-2, the sixth-best Opening Day winning percentage in MLB. Of the 150 Opening Day games in franchise history, two of them — both against their division-rival St. Louis Cardinals — ended in ties.</p>



<p>The first tie was on April 12, 1911, with a score of 3-3, all three Cubs RBI coming from Cubs left fielder Jimmy Sheckard.</p>



<p>The second tie came 54 years later, on April 12, 1965, as the Cubs and Cardinals tied 10-10. "Mr. Cub" himself, Ernie Banks, led the Cubs with three hits and four RBI in five at-bats.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most memorable season-openers (non-tie category!) in Cubs history:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">July 24, 2020</h3>



<p>In what may have been the most unique and challenging MLB season ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic, starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks shined on the mound, striking out nine Milwaukee Brewers and holding the Brew Crew to three hits in a 3-0 win in the latest Opening Day ever.</p>



<p>The game would've featured thunderous applause from the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field, but no fans were in the stands, except for a few who made their way onto the rooftops near the ballpark.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">





</figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">April 4, 1994</h3>



<p>Centerfielder Karl "Tuffy" Rhodes came into the 1994 season with five Major League home runs over four seasons with the Houston Astros, but that didn't prevent Cubs manager Tom Trebelhorn from penciling Tuffy into the leadoff spot on Opening Day.</p>



<p>The Cubs' 1994 Opening Day opponent was the New York Mets, who tabbed pitcher Dwight "Doc" Gooden as their Opening Day starter.</p>



<p>By 1994, Gooden had already made a strong name for himself. He won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1984, the National League Cy Young Award in 1985 and helped lead the Mets to a World Series championship in 1986. He was also named a National League All-Star four times prior to 1994.</p>



<p>Despite Gooden's strong resume and Rhodes not being known as a power hitter, Tuffy stepped up to the occasion and turned in a 4-for-4 performance, drilling three home runs off Gooden that memorable day.</p>



<p>Rhodes' offensive explosion turned out to be contagious, as the teams scored a combined 20 runs.</p>



<p>Despite Rhodes' theatrical performance, the Cubs actually lost the game, 12-8, but his home run hat trick has not been forgotten among Cub fans.</p>



<p>Throughout his MLB career, Rhodes hit just 13 home runs. He played in MLB for one more season, in 1995, before playing professional baseball in Japan for 13 years, where he found considerable success.</p>



<p>Over his 13 years in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, Tuffy Rhodes hit 464 home runs, the most among foreign-born players in that league.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">April 8, 1969</h3>



<p>On Opening Day 1969, "Mr. Cub" belted two home runs, three hits and five RBI, but Willie Smith ended up stealing the show against the Phillies.</p>



<p>Philadelphia's Don Money uncorked a game-tying home run off Fergie Jenkins in the ninth inning before hitting a go-ahead RBI double off Phil Regan in the 11th.</p>



<p>In the home half of the 11th, Cubs manager Leo Durocher told Smith to grab a bat and pinch-hit for Jim Hickman with one out and Randy Hundley on first.</p>



<p>Smith took Barry Lersch deep for a walk-off home run, giving the Cubs a 7-6 win and sending the Wrigley Field crowd into a frenzy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">April 6, 1971</h3>



<p>The 1971 season saw Cubs starting pitcher Fergie Jenkins win the National League Cy Young Award.</p>



<p>He began his Cy Young campaign on April 6, 1971, against division rival St. Louis and pitching phenom Bob Gibson.</p>



<p>Jenkins outdueled Gibson and the Cubs won the game 2-1, thanks to a walk-off dinger in the 10th inning courtesy of Billy Williams.</p>



<p>Gibson pitched 9 1/3, while Jenkins amazingly lasted all 10 in a tremendous pitcher's duel from a bygone era.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">March 31, 2003</h3>



<p>The Cubs kicked off their star-crossed 2003 campaign with a 15-2 rout of the New York Mets at Shea Stadium.</p>



<p>Corey Patterson tallied four hits, including two RBI singles off Mets starter Tom Glavine, and two home runs off reliever Mike Bacsik.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
</div>


<p>Patterson's seven RBI are an Opening Day record for the Cubs, and that performance in 2003 tied him with Minnesota's Brant Alyea for most the RBI in a season-opener, with Alyea also racking up seven in 1970.</p>



<p>This game started a memorable 2003 season in which the Cubs won a division title and almost made it to the World Series for the first time since 1945.</p>



<p>Almost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">March 31, 2008</h3>



<p>This was another "almost" season for the Cubs, and it started off with one of the most memorable debuts in franchise history.</p>



<p>Outfielder Kosuke Fukudome, a Japanese rookie playing his first MLB game, thrilled the home crowd at rainy Wrigley Field by racking up two hits and a walk in his first three plate appearances against the visiting Milwaukee Brewers.</p>



<p>Fukudome came to the plate a fourth time in the bottom of the ninth, with the Cubs down 3-0 but threatening off Brewers closer Eric Gagne with two on and nobody out. He blasted a 3-1 pitch into the first rows of the right-center bleachers, tying the game and sending the crowd into total pandemonium.</p>



<p>Alas, the Brewers would go on to win the game, 4-3, in extra innings, thanks to a key leadoff double in the top of the 10th by a pinch-hitter.</p>



<p>That pinch-hitter? Craig Counsell.</p>



<p>The 2008 Cubs rolled to 97 wins and the division title, with fans bellowing "This is the year!" all summer.</p>



<p>It wasn't.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">April 4, 2016</h3>



<p>Now, THIS was the year.</p>



<p>It started off on the West Coast with an easy 9-0 win over the Los Angeles Angels. Coming off his Cy Young-winning season of 2015, Jake Arrieta tossed seven dominant shutout innings to get the 2016 season started on the right foot.</p>



<p>Just some hours shy of exactly seven months later, the Cubs were World Series champions for the first time since 1908.</p>
