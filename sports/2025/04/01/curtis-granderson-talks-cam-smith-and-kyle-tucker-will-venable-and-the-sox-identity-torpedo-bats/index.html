<p>CHICAGO (WGN) — The Cubs were crushed by the Dodgers and Diamondbacks. The White Sox are off to a respectable start. Then there is the latest polarizing baseball conversation item—torpedo bats.</p>



<p>TBS Major League Baseball analyst and former three-time MLB All-Star Curtis Granderson sat down with Chris Boden to talk shop about the Cubs, White Sox, and the latest sensation sweeping the baseball nation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cam Smith's rise in Houston</h3>



<p>The North Siders sit at 2-4 after six games to begin the 2025 MLB season, but Granderson's advice for Cubs fans is to take a deep breath and wait for the sunshine to reappear at Wrigley Field.</p>



<p>"I wouldn't panic too much right now," Granderson said. "Just like it's cloudy outside right now, the sun is going to come back out and it's going to be warm. You're going to have your shorts on, sitting out there in the ivy and the bleachers having a good time."</p>



<p>A major storyline set to play out this season for the Cubs will be the development of Cam Smith—the top prospect they sent to the Houston Astros for Kyle Tucker—and how not only the All-Star outfielder plays, but if the North Siders' front office will open up the piggy bank to keep him once his current contract expires this offseason.</p>



<p>Smith turned heads in the Astros organization this spring. The 22-year-old prospect, who only has 32 games of professional baseball experience to his name, demolished spring training pitchers to the tune of a .342/.419/.711 slash line.</p>



<p>"The fact that [the Cubs] let him go and he makes the team, speaks volumes to not only what the Astros saw in him, but it gives confidence to him," Granderson said. "When you're a young player, you're trying to see if you're going to make the team. We know, historically, teams can mess with you a little bit."</p>



<p>Granderson compared Kris Bryant's rise to the Big Leagues as a possible comparison point to pay attention to as Smith gets MLB playing time in Houston. </p>



<p>Bryant tore apart Double-A and Triple-A pitching in 2014, one year before eventually making his MLB debut and winning National League Rookie of the Year honors. Between the Tennessee Smokies and the Iowa Cubs, Bryant slashed .325/.438/.661 with 43 home runs and 110 RBI.</p>



<p>Showing signs he was clearly ready for the Big Leagues, the Cubs still opted to send him to Triple-A just long enough to cost him a year of service time and delay his free agency eligibility in 2015.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kyle Tucker's likelihood of staying put in Chicago</h3>



<p>"Now you bring in Kyle Tucker—someone who's been on winning teams who brings in experience, who's played at a very high level and plays great offensively, defensively, and runs the bases," Granderson said. "If he plays to the level everyone anticipates and expects, you hope that the Cubs go out there and make a push towards him."</p>



<p>Tucker is set to become an unrestricted free agent heading into the 2025-26 offseason, barring he and the Cubs come to an agreement on a contract extension before the season ends. </p>



<p>The two sides avoided arbitration heading into the 2025 season after initially being $2.5 million apart on contract discussions, with Tucker signing a one-year, $16.5 million deal on Jan. 16.</p>



<p>"Kyle Tucker has earned the situation to be a free agent," Granderson said. "Even though he loves it here—or could love it here because it's still early—and potentially ends up winning a championship here, he still has 29 other teams that may look at him and say, 'You know what? We really like you.'"</p>



<p>Granderson also points to a lack of knowledge when it comes to Tucker's preferences. Where his home is, where his favorite stadium is, and other factors could all play a role in where he lands this offseason.</p>



<p>Tucker is coming off three straight American League All-Star Team selections that include a 2022 Gold Glove and a 2023 Silver Slugger Award. Had it not been for injuries cutting his 2024 season short, Tucker was on pace for his best season as a pro.</p>



<p>In 78 games, Tucker slashed .289/.408/.585 with 23 home runs and 49 RBI while walking (56) more than he struck out (54).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Will Venable and creating a club identity for the White Sox</h3>



<p>"I always think change is a good thing. Especially after having the season that you did last year, you have to mix up some things there," Granderson said. "Starting at the top was what the White Sox decided to do. You bring in Will Venable, who has played at a very high level and someone who was on a coaching staff that won a championship so I think that brings some things there too.</p>



<p>"One of the things I heard around baseball was there was a lack of identity, a lack of leadership over there with the White Sox. The fact Will Venable has come in and completely turned some things around in his short tenure there speaks volume to not only him as an individual, but the respect he gets from the players over there."</p>



<p>The White Sox are off to a 2-2 start on the strength of impressive starting pitching. Sean Burke, Jonathan Cannon, Davis Martin and Martin Perez have combined to pitch 23 shutout innings.</p>



<p>According to ESPN Stats and Info, the South Siders' starting rotation is the fourth since 1974 to not give an earned run over their first four games, joining the 2019 Toronto Blue Jays, 2013 San Francisco Giants and the 1976 Milwaukee Brewers. </p>



<p>The '19 Blue Jays went on to win 67 games, while the '13 Giants earned 76 victories, and the '76 Brewers took home 66 wins.</p>



<p>Granderson and Will Venable's MLB playing careers overlapped from 2008-16. The first time the two faced off against one another was in an early August 2013 series between the San Diego Padres and the New York Yankees.</p>



<p>Granderson went 0-4 in the first game they played against each other on Aug. 2, 2013. Venable didn't start, but he did hit a pinch-hit solo home run with two outs in the eighth inning. The Padres went on to win that matchup, 7-2.</p>



<p>Granderson went 2-4 the next day on Aug. 3 with a two-run home run and a stolen base, while Venable got the start and went 1-4 with a double. The Yankees won 3-0 behind seven shutout innings from Ivan Nova and a 1-2-3 save in the ninth inning from Mariano Rivera, his 35th save of the season up until that point.</p>



<p>Granderson went 1-1 with three walks, while Venable went 2-3 with a walk and two stolen bases in the series finale, which the Padres won, 6-3.</p>



<p>The two went on to play against each other ten more times across the 2014-15 MLB seasons.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Torpedo bats and player development</h3>



<p>The first thing Granderson thought about when he saw the torpedo bats debuted by the Yankees this season was playing whiffle ball in his backyard growing up in the south suburbs of Chicagoland.</p>



<p>"I think back to playing whiffle ball in the backyard with that big, fat red bat," Granderson said. "As long as you threw it somewhere near me, I was going to have a chance at having success hitting this thing."</p>



<p>After a little trip down memory lane, what Granderson found interesting was that in spite of the initial outrage expressed by some fans and MLB pitchers, the Bronx Bombers are technically operating within the guidelines of the current rule book.</p>



<p>What's even more interesting to Granderson though, is how the analytics of critiquing the shape of the bat will affect player development as time goes on.</p>



<p>"The analytics guys noticed that some of their players have been hitting the ball on certain parts of the bat," Granderson said. "Now if we rewind, that means that you were mishitting the ball. That means you were getting jammed or you were hitting the ball off the end [of the bat]. What you did before was you worked on the player's hitting and [you used] practice and drills to hopefully help the player not hit the ball in that spot.</p>



<p>"What they're saying is, we're going to continue working on the player, but we're going to give them a different bat so, where you consistently hit it, is where you can hopefully have some more success. That's the part that is very interesting. If a player is struggling a little bit, we'll just go ahead and give you a different tool and don't look at the person who is actually struggling."</p>



<p>Torpedo bats stormed onto baseball's main stage behind an offensive barrage from Yankees bats during their opening series against the Brewers.</p>



<p>New York pounded out nine home runs in a 20-6 obliteration of Milwaukee on Opening Day, which included three straight homers on three straight pitches to open the game. The Yankees went on to hit a major league record 15 home runs in their first three games.</p>
