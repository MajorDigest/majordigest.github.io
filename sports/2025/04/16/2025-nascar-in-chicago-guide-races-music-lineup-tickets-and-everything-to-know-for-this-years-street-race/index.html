<p>For the third year in a row, NASCAR racing will take over Grant Park and its surrounding streets during the heart of a Chicago summer.</p>



<p>The NASCAR Chicago Street Race is back for its third edition in and around Grant Park on Saturday and Sunday, July 5 and 6, after NASCAR announced in August that the event would return to cap off the Fourth of July holiday weekend.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
</div>


<p>And like the first two editions, this year's Chicago Street Race is more than just NASCAR races. The weekend will be packed with entertainment in and around Grant Park, including major music acts. </p>



<p>One piece of the entertainment puzzle was announced early last month, as the Zac Brown Band will headline the weekend by performing on Saturday, July 5, at the Busch Light Summer Series Stage following the NASCAR Xfinity Series The Loop 110 race.</p>



<p>Other feature events will be announced leading up to the weekend. You can keep track of all the news related to the Chicago Street Race by visiting WGN's NASCAR in Chicago homepage.</p>



<p>With more event details still to emerge, here's a complete guide to the third edition of the NASCAR Chicago Street Race weekend. The majority of this information is from the NASCAR Chicago Street Race homepage, will be updated regularly with all event information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The schedule (subject to change)</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">July 5 (Saturday)</h3>



<p><strong>9:30 a.m.:</strong> Gates open</p>



<p><strong>10-10:50 a.m.:</strong> NASCAR Xfinity Series practice</p>



<p><strong>11 a.m.-noon:</strong> NASCAR Xfinity Series qualifying</p>



<p><strong>12:30-1:20 p.m.:</strong> NASCAR Cup Series practice</p>



<p><strong>1:30-2:30 p.m.:</strong> NASCAR Cup Series qualifying</p>



<p><strong>3:30 p.m.:</strong> The Loop 110 NASCAR Xfinity Series race</p>



<p><strong>TBD:</strong> Post-race Victory Lane celebration and performance by Zac Brown Band</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">July 6 (Sunday)</h3>



<p><strong>10 a.m.:</strong> Gates open</p>



<p><strong>11 a.m.-TBA:</strong> Pre-race entertainment begins</p>



<p><strong>1 p.m.:</strong> Grant Park 165 NASCAR Cup Series race</p>



<p><strong>TBD:</strong> Post-race Victory Lane celebration</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The races</h3>



<p>Once again, NASCAR in Chicago will feature two street races: The Loop 110 Xfinity Series race on Saturday and the Grant Park 165 Cup Series race on Sunday.</p>



<p>After rain and darkness hampered both races during the inaugural event in 2023, they were shortened for the second event in 2024. That's the distance they'll be again this year.</p>



<p>The Loop 110 covers 110 miles over 50 laps.</p>



<p>The Grant Park 165, the main event of the weekend featuring the top racers in NASCAR, covers 165 miles over 70 laps.</p>



<p>Despite the shorter race length from 2023, last year's Grant Park 165 was again hampered by rain and ultimately had to be shortened, too.</p>



<p>Following a delay of close to two hours as storms rolled through Chicago, and with NASCAR imposing a darkness cutoff, Alex Bowman won the shortened race in the No. 48 car to snap an 80-race winless drought.</p>







<p>Last year's The Loop 110, on the other hand, went the distance, with road-course specialist Shane van Gisbergen winning. He also won the inaugural Cup Series Chicago Street Race in 2023, in his first NASCAR start.</p>







<p>Obviously, nobody can control the weather, but NASCAR drivers and race officials are certainly hoping this year's Grant Park 165 will finally go the full distance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The course</h3>



<p>Drivers will navigate the same road-course footprint in 2025 as they did in 2024. It contains 12 turns over 2.2 miles. </p>



<p>Here's a map of the course:</p>







<p>The start/finish line is on South Columbus Drive, in front of Buckingham Fountain.</p>



<p>The course will include sections of streets that surround and are adjacent to Grant Park, specifically S. Columbus Dr., East Jackson Drive, South Michigan Avenue, East Congress Plaza Drive, East Roosevelt Road, East Balbo Drive and DuSable Lake Shore Drive.</p>



<p>Click HERE for a fully zoomable course map.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The grounds</h3>



<p>In addition to the course itself, the NASCAR Street Race grounds will have plenty of attractions for fans and spectators, as well as various food and beverage options.</p>



<p>NASCAR Village at Butler Field is open to the general public and is located on the north end of the grounds, accessible via public entry. This area is ringed by NASCAR Cup garages and NASCAR Cup Series haulers.</p>



<p>See below:</p>







<p>For ticketholders, the north entry is located off Jackson Drive and features a Fan Plaza, which is open to all ticketholders, as well as an official NASCAR merchandise store. Entry to club and premier seating areas is also located in this area.</p>



<p>Columbus Drive, which is where Pit Road and the start/finish line are situated, is just west of the Fan Plaza. On the other side of the start/finish line and Pit Road is the Busch Light Summer Music Series stage, where the Zac Brown Band will perform on Saturday.</p>



<p>See below:</p>







<p>Festival Field is located on the south end of the grounds, with a south entry for ticketholders located inside the race course, between Columbus Dr. to the west and DuSable LSD to the East.</p>



<p>See below:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The streets, traffic and parking</h3>



<p><strong>STREETS AND TRAFFIC</strong></p>



<p>The City of Chicago and NASCAR officials have announced the traffic plan for this year's event.</p>



<p>According to a city news release, NASCAR and city officials collaborated to trim nearly two weeks off the overall build time this year, reducing total setup and breakdown in Grant Park to 25 days. Thatâ€™s down from 43 days for the first event in 2023 and 38 days for the second event in 2024.</p>



<p>Additionally, the city says,&nbsp;traffic and street closures&nbsp;related to the course build have been reduced to 18 days this year, seven days less than in 2023 and one day less than in 2024.</p>



<p>The first street closures begin Thursday, June 19, then select streets will begin reopening on Sunday, July 6, and Monday, July 7, following the conclusion of the event. DuSable Lake Shore Drive will begin reopening Monday, July 7, at 6 a.m., with all NASCAR-related demobilization activity expected to conclude by end-of-day on July 14.</p>



<p>Of note:</p>



<ul>
<li>The total park build this year will take an estimated 25 days, including setup and takedown.</li>



<li>The first NASCAR-related activity in Grant Park wonâ€™t take place until 16 days before race weekend.</li>



<li>Street closures related to the course build have been reduced by one day from 2024, for a total traffic impact of 18 days this year.</li>



<li>NASCAR has adjusted the park load-in and load-out locations to allow East Ida B. Wells Drive, from East Congress Plaza Drive to South Columbus Drive, to be open a full 20 days longer.</li>
</ul>



<p>Click HERE for the city's full traffic and street closure plan for this year's event. Click HERE for a previous WGN story with a full schedule and breakdown of street closures.</p>



<p><strong>PARKING</strong></p>



<p>As for parking, there are several facilities nearby that will be available for the event, including Millennium Garages. Every public and private parking facility will have accessible parking spaces for vehicles with an accessible parking placard or plate. </p>



<p>Parking fees vary, depending on the facility.</p>



<p>However, parking will be limited in and around Grant Park, so public transportation is highly recommended via CTA and Metra.</p>



<p>Ridesharing is also encouraged. All rideshare pick-ups must occur west of State Street, between Roosevelt Road and Randolph Street.</p>



<p>Additionally, a drop-off-only location will be available on Level 1 of the Millennium Lakeside Garage (5 S. Columbus Dr.). This location is drop-off only. All pick-ups will occur west of State St.</p>



<p>Also, no on-site camping is available for the NASCAR Chicago Street Race. You can visit Choose Chicago's hotel finder to research accommodations in Chicago.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The economic impact</h3>



<p>According to a NASCAR news release in October, last year's Chicago Street Race weekend delivered a total economic impact of $128 million to the city, an increase of 17% on the inaugural Chicago Street Race in 2023.</p>



<p>The release cited the Choose Chicago and Chicago Sports Commission's economic and media impact reports for the 2024 Chicago Street Race.</p>



<p>NASCAR also highlighted the following metrics from those reports:</p>



<ul>
<li>The 2024 Chicago Street Race weekend supported 865 jobs, 115 more than the 2023 event.</li>



<li>53,063 unique attendees took part in the 2024 festivities, up from 47,405 in 2023, due in part to the introduction of single-day tickets.</li>



<li>Out of 53,063 total unique attendees, 27,188 (51%) traveled to Chicago solely or primarily for the 2024 event. These attendees traveled from 25 countries, 66% more than in 2023.</li>



<li>The 2024 Chicago Street Race generated 38,095 hotel room nights, up 29% from 2023's 29,532 hotel room nights.</li>



<li>80% of surveyed attendees said they would recommend Chicago as a travel destination, and 63% said they plan to return to Chicago for vacation outside of the race.</li>



<li>Over 11% of attendees in 2024 said it was their first time in Chicago, more than twice as many as in 2023.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, NASCAR said last year's event generated $9.6 million in state and local taxes and contributed $43.6 million in media value, citing reports completed by Temple University's Sports Industry Research Center.</p>



<p>"Weâ€˜re incredibly proud of the fact that weâ€˜ve been able to deliver on our promise to build something truly unique and authentic to Chicago that not only drives tourism but does so in a way with community at its core," Julie Giese, Chicago Street Race President, said in the economic impact release. "This incredible year-over-year growth clearly shows that the Chicago Street Race has become a mainstay of the Chicago summer calendar, and we look forward to building on this incredible momentum in 2025."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What else?</h3>



<p><strong>COMMUNITY IMPACT</strong></p>



<p>In addition to its economic impact on the city during race weekend, the NASCAR Chicago Street Race is committed to Chicago year-round, with a full-time Chicago office.</p>



<p>When NASCAR announced in August that the Chicago Street Race would return for a third straight year in 2025, it cited more than $5 million invested in local community initiatives year-to-date through partnerships with organizations and non-profits across the city. </p>
