<h3>Ranked teams</h3>
<p><b>No. 3 Pittsburg 55, Heritage 7</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Pirates cruised at home past Heritage in their first Bay Valley Athletic League opener, building a 41-point lead by halftime. Quarterback </span><b>Carlos Torres</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> completed 10-of-11 passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. Sophomore QB </span><b>Javale Jones</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> passed for 137 yards and two scores and added a rushing touchdown. <strong>R.J.

<p>Miramonte chewed up a lot of clock, keeping Acalanes&#8217; offense on the sideline, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to upset the visiting Dons (7-0, 1-0) in this Diablo Athletic League Foothill Division opener. <strong>Deonte Littlejohn&#8217;s</strong> 1-yard touchdown run accounted for Acalanes&#8217; only first-half TD as the Dons had just two possessions in the opening 24 minutes, the first ending on a goal-line stand. Leading 7-3 at halftime, Acalanes stretched its advantage to 14-3 when <strong>Tyler Winkles</strong> hit <strong>Sean Tandler</strong> from 3 yards out. Miramonte (4-3, 0-1) cut the margin to 14-10 with six minutes left on a 23-yard pass from <strong>Carson Blair</strong> to <strong>Andrew Bjornson</strong>. But Acalanes responded as <strong>Josh Elerts&#8217;</strong> running helped set up Winkles&#8217; 20-yard pass to <strong>Kyler Roberts</strong> to make it 21-10 with 2:06 left. <strong>George Gilbert</strong> had five receptions for 80 yards and eight tackles to lead Miramonte. <strong>Harrison Feusier</strong> and <strong>David Roman</strong> made impressive open-field tackles to slow down Acalanes&#8217; screen attack, and <strong>Tres Buster</strong> added a fourth-quarter sack. <em>&#8212; Darren Sabedra</em></p>
<p><b>No. 6 Los Gatos 47, Sacred Heart Prep 0</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Los Gatos (3-3, 1-0) took out its frustrations from three close nonleague losses to blast Sacred Heart Prep (4-2, 0-1) in a Peninsula Athletic League Bay Division Opener. The Wildcats led 33-0 at halftime. </span><b>Grayson Doslak </b><span style="font-weight: 400">got the scoring started with an 11-yard run. </span><b>Devonte Troutt</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> scored two rushing touchdowns. </span><b>Max Thomas </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><b>Beau Musser</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> caught touchdown passes from </span><b>Callum Schweitzer</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Shane Harmer </b><span style="font-weight: 400">caught one in the second half from backup QB </span><b>Liam Sullivan.</b> <b>Lane Newman </b><span style="font-weight: 400">returned a blocked punt for another score. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212; Glenn Reeves</span></i></p>

<p>Tied 14-14 on the road at halftime, San Ramon Valley erupted in the second half, scoring touchdowns on three of its first four offensive plays to defeat Amador Valley in an East Bay Athletic League Mountain Division opener. <strong>Cole Dawes</strong> threw touchdown passes to <strong>Dietrick Burks Jr.</strong> and <strong>Colton Fitzgibbon</strong> and <strong>Xavier O’Guinn</strong> scored on a 75-yard run to break the game open. In the first half, <strong>Cassius Ryan</strong> had a 35-yard TD run and <strong>Owen Power</strong> returned a kickoff for a score for SRV (5-2, 1-0). Power also had a second-half interception as SRV&#8217;s defense raised its level of play after halftime. &#8220;Overall it was a good win in all three phases of the game,&#8221; SRV coach Aaron Becker said. Amador Valley dropped to 2-5, 0-1. <em>&#8212; Darren Sabedra</em></p>

<p><strong>Andrew Franzino</strong> completed five of six passes on a surgical scoring drive in the latter half of the fourth quarter that ended with junior running back <strong>Motu Keanaaina</strong> barreling across the goal line from a yard out to seal the West Catholic Athletic League win for the host Lancers. <em>Evan Webeck has the game story here. </em></p>
<p><b>No. 10 Campolindo 28, No. 16 Monte Vista 21</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After surrendering 21 first-half points, Campolindo shut out the host Mustangs in the second half to win the nonleague game. Quarterback </span><b>Reid Habas</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> completed 16-of-23 passes for 229 yards and three touchdowns to lead Campo. </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/10/no-10-campolindo-gets-statement-win-with-comeback-victory-over-no-16-monte-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathan Canilao was in Danville and has the story </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>

<p><b>Irvington 21, Washington-Fremont 16</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a game that effectively ended twice, Irvington closed out its crosstown rivals with back-to-back red zone stops late in the fourth quarter.

<h3>South Bay/Peninsula</h3>
<p><b>Christopher 27, Leigh 17</b></p>
