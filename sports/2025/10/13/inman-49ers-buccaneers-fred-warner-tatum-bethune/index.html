    <p>TAMPA, Fla. – Something was amiss – and alarming &#8212; from the start of Fred Warner’s final play this 49ers season.</p>
<p>No one lined up at right defensive end.</p>
<p>Buccaneers left tackle Tristan Wirfs, with no one to block, unimpededly charged ahead 5 yards into Warner, who tried shedding the All-Pro and spun toward ballcarrier Rachaad White.</p>
<p>Warner’s right ankle got trapped under safety Ji’Ayir Brown as the latter tackled White for a 10-yard gain. Warner’s foot emerged at a nauseating 90-degree angle. Wirfs immediately signaled to the 49ers’ sideline for medical attention.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mykel Williams&#39; third-down sack forced Bucs&#39; punt on series they lost Fred Warner (ankle)</p>
<p>On that Warner play, Rachaad White had a 10-yard run when tackled by Ji&#39;Ayir Brown, who rolled up into Warner. Niners had only 10 defenders on field, Williams was missing at RDE</p>
<p>&mdash; Cam Inman (@CamInman) October 12, 2025</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>On that 49ers sideline were defensive ends Mykel Williams and Sam Okuayinonu, who’ve rotated in opposite Bryce Huff in the wake of Nick Bosa’s season-ending knee injury in Week 3.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I’m not up and some drives I am,” Williams said. “It was just a substitution error.”</p>
<p>Before the snap, defensive coordinator Robert Saleh was watching intensely on the sideline, hands on his knees. Huff was at left defensive end while Kalia Davis and C.J. West, each with a cast on a hand, lined up as the defensive tackles.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just a defining moment of the 49ers’ 31-19 loss to the NFC-leading Buccaneers. It could be the season’s literal breaking point.</p>
<p>“Seeing him go down, a guy that doesn’t go down, it’s draining,” Brown said. “It kind of drained the stadium, bro. Everybody felt that.”</p>
<p>This 49ers season, it seems inevitable that a star will go down weekly. Warner might be the most irreplaceable when combining his vocal leadership and superstar talent. He played through a broken bone in that same ankle for the final 13 games last season. He is four tackles shy of passing Patrick Willis for most in 49ers history.</p>
<p>They’ll miss Warner. And they sure missed a defensive end on that fateful play. It&#8217;s almost as baffling as Skyy Moore fielding punts at the 2- and 3-yard lines.</p>
<p>On to 10 other things that caught my eye:</p>

<p>Warner understandably did not speak to reporters. He did address his teammates in the locker room for a minute. Their testimonials recreated the scene:</p>
<p>&#8220;That broke my heart, bro. It was sad,&#8221; cornerback Chase Lucas said. &#8220;No tears (from Warner). He&#8217;s a gangster. But I can tell you this: there were tears in the crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tatum Bethune, Warner’s replacement: “Fred is the heart of this team. We kind of expected he was going to say something to cheer us up a bit.”</p>
<p>Safety Malik Mustafa: “It was definitely something we needed. To lose a leader like that, you could see the energy just kind of wither. Him being in good spirits… it’s promising. It helps us keep a level head.”</p>
<p>Punter Thomas Morstead: “That’s what leaders do.”</p>

<p>Right after expressing condolences for Warner, coach Kyle Shanahan said: “I have a lot of faith in Tatum. He’s the next man up and has to do it throughout the year.”</p>
<p>Bethune, a seventh-round pick last year as the No. 251st pick, takes over as the play-relaying middle linebacker, a role he impressed in through training camp. He finished with a team-high 10 tackles Sunday.</p>
<p>“I prepare like I’m a starter just for reasons like this &#8212; Fred getting hurt,” Bethune said. “It’s unfortunate but it&#8217;s why you prepare.”</p>
<p>Who will replace Warner as the pregame hype man in team huddles? Probably the starting quarterback, whether that’s Brock Purdy if he’s back or Mac Jones. Trent Williams, Christian McCaffrey and Deommodore Lenoir are the only healthy captains. George Kittle certainly can rally the troops, and he could be back next Sunday night against Atlanta.</p>

<p>When Warner appeared on Monday Night Football’s “Manningcast” with Peyton and Eli Manning last week, some 49ers fans cringed, fearing a revival of the so-called Manningcast Curse. Never mind that Warner shared authentic insight as the Jacksonville Jaguars rallied to win.</p>
<p>When the Manningcast debuted in 2021 as a neat alternative to the mainstream broadcast, several high-profile guests lost their next game: Tom Brady, Travis Kelce, Russell Wilson, Rob Gronkowski and Matthew Stafford.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fred Warner on ManningCast tonight<br />He’s in All Pro form again but could garner DPOY at this rate of 49ers’ wins. They’re 4-1, NFC-best 4-0 in conference https://t.co/70Anhjh9qh</p>
<p>&mdash; Cam Inman (@CamInman) October 6, 2025</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This season, the 49ers have lost far too many high-profile players to injury. Of course, last season, the 49ers lost Christian McCaffrey, inciting talk of a Madden video-game cover curse.</p>
<p>In 2023, McCaffrey went on the Manningcast and then ran for 103 yards and a touchdown in a Christmas night loss to Baltimore. The 49ers’ George Kittle was a 2022 Manningcast guest, and he followed with a two-touchdown, 120-yard outing in a win over Washington.</p>
<p>This season, the Philadelphia Eagles’ Saquon Barkley and the Indianapolis Colts’ Daniel Jones were Manningcast guests and have stayed healthy. Curses don’t exist, but if they do, these 49ers are cursed.</p>

<p>Once Demarcus Robinson dropped a pass at midfield in front of Shanahan, the coach tore down the sideline to chew out Jauan Jennings. As the 49ers’ two-minute drill continued, so did Shanahan’s terseness with Jennings, who at one point talked back to his coach and was restrained by Mike Anderson, Shanahan’s security detail.</p>
<p>What gives? “Oh man, you have to ask him,” Jennings said.</p>
<p>“Intense competitive conversations,” Shanahan said. “But we’re good.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Demarcus Robinson drops a pass neasr midfield in front of Kyle Shanahan &#8230; and as next play ensues (31-yard Robinson catch), Shanahan storms down the sideline to shout at Jauan Jennings. </p>
<p>Good times here in Tampa</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Cam Inman (@CamInman) October 12, 2025</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If the 49ers weren’t so thin at receiver, Jennings would and still could be a trade candidate. The incentive-laden contract he held out for in training camp is set to expire after this season.</p>
<p>He had no targets in the first half and finished with a 7-yard grab amid three targets, the final of which was intercepted with five-plus minutes left. After playing 53 of 69 snaps, he revealed he’s not only dealing with ankle and shoulder injuries but five broken ribs — and an angry boss.</p>

<p>Mac Jones lost for the first time in four starts as Brock Purdy (toe) did not suit up or travel. This was Jones’ second straight start, and for the second straight game, his former Patriots teammate Kendrick Bourne totaled 142 receiving yards.</p>
<p>However, miscommunication led to a first-series interception, with Bourne cutting inside on third down and Jones’ pass sailing the other way into the hands of Kindle Vildor. The Bucs converted that turnover into a touchdown run and the first points scored all season against the 49ers in a first quarter.</p>
<p>“We have a great connection. We just weren’t on the same page on that one, so it’s on me,” Jones said.</p>
<p>Shanahan, however, said he wouldn’t pin that interception on Jones because it was a busted route against a blitz. When the Bucs intercepted Jones again with 5:43 remaining, Shanahan called it a “tough one.”</p>

<p>It’s odd to celebrate McCaffrey’s all-around greatness when the 49ers, for the first time in their history, failed to rush for at least 85 yards in a fifth straight games, a stat unearthed by The Associated Press’ Josh Dubow.</p>
<p>But McCaffrey, for a sixth straight game, produced over 100 yards from scrimmage (54 rushing, 57 receiving). No running back in NFL history had previously breached 50 yards receiving in each of his team’s first six games.</p>
<p>McCaffrey hasn’t eclipsed 100 rushing yards in a game since 2023, but he did score the 49ers’ first rushing touchdown this season Sunday. That 1-yard, go-ahead scoring plunge came as he followed key blocks, and he feared he may have speared teammate Jake Tonges in the ribs along the way.</p>
<p>“Sometimes when you’re able to play, it’s a blessing. It really is, and I don’t take it for granted,” said McCaffrey, who earlier lamented Warner’s “heartbreaking” injury, adding the linebacker is one of the best players and leaders he’s had as a teammate.</p>

<p>Don’t blame Brown for Warner’s injury. Brown did his job making a tackle, and he did so as a starting safety for the first time this season. Jason Pinnock got benched. Rookie safety Marques Sigle rotated with Mustapha, who played 21 of the 53 defense snaps in his season debut.</p>
<p>Sigle got beat for a 45-yard touchdown on a post for the Bucs’ final touchdown and has struggled in coverage all rookie season. Who starts next Sunday? Maybe Mustapha.</p>
<p>“I was excited to get back out there. I definitely got eased into it,” Mustapha said. “Long journey and I’m blessed to be back on the field.”</p>

<p>Three plays after Warner’s injury, Williams produced his first career sack by fighting past guard Ben Bredeson and dropping Baker Mayfield on third down. Williams celebrated with a sack dance he’s calling “The Rodeo.”</p>
<p>“It was great to get it out of the way. I finally got one,” Williams said. “It was extreme effort, that is what it boiled down to.”</p>
<p>That is all the 49ers got from their anemic pass defense in dire times without Nick Bosa. They had no other hits on Mayfield, recorded no interceptions for a 13th straight game and totaled just two pass breakups.</p>

<p>The home crowd serenaded Mayfield with “MVP” chants late in the fourth quarter and after the Bucs officially improved to 5-1.</p>

<p>Mayfield committed no turnovers, threw for two touchdowns, passed for 256 yards (without his three best receivers), and had a 15-yard scramble on third-and-14 prior to his final scoring strike.</p>
<p>“He’s a fighter. That long third-down he got, that just shows Baker’s game,” Mustapha said. “He’s a great pocket passer and can make all the throws, but he’s a competitor. You saw it on full display today.”</p>
<p>Mayfield said of the MVP chants: “It’s awesome to have the support, don’t get me wrong, but we’re just getting started.”</p>

<p>The 49ers are in a three-way tie atop the NFC West with the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams. All are 4-2, but the 49ers hold a tiebreaker with a 3-0 division record. The Arizona Cardinals are last at 2-4.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of season left. We’re 4-2. And we have a good football team,” linebacker Luke Gifford said. “It’s obviously tough losing (Warner) and he’s our brother and it sucks, but we have a lot of football left.”</p>
<p>Added Bethune: “We’re a 4-2 team now and we just have to do better.”</p>
<p>The 49ers will next appear in prime time on Sunday when they host the Atlanta Falcons, who take a 2-2 record into tonight’s home game against the Buffalo Bills (4-1). There is no ManningCast for that game.</p>
