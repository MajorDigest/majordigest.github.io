Chiles (Net -12) carried the ball nine times for 13 yards and a touchdown.</p><h3>3rd quarter</h3><p>With bragging rights and a state championship up for grabs, the Wolverines opened the second half

line.</p><p>Marshall gave Haynes a blow and gained two yards on the next play, setting up a second and eight on the 21-yard line.</p><p>Underwood threw incomplete on second and eight on a rail route, fumbling the ball on the next play after the Spartans blitzed and got a strip sack.</p><p>But the Spartans were called for offside and gave the Wolverines an extra five yards on third down.</p><p>With a breath of fresh air, Haynes gained six yards to extend the drive.</p><p>The NBC broadcast said the offside penalty was incorrect, as the play appeared to be timed correctly, but the Wolverines got a gift.</p><p>After a brief injury timeout for the Spartans, Underwood handed the ball off to Haynes for a five-yard gain.</p><p>With the ball on the six-yard line, Haynes bounced the ball outside for an easy walk-in touchdown.</p><p>Zvada knocked in the extra point to cap off a seven-play 71-yard drive that ate up 3:02 while taking a 17-7 lead.</p><p>Needing a big stop, the Wolverines’ defense

called.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Derrick_Moore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Derrick_Moore/"><b>Derrick Moore

the quarterback keeper for a two-yard gain, setting up a pivotal third and seven for both teams.</p><p>A passing play was called, and Chiles eluded a defender and threw the ball in the dirt to a wide-open receiver, which would’ve gained some yards close to a first down.</p><p>Eckley punted the ball 48-yards to Morgan who returned it two yards to the Wolverines 46-yard line.</p><p>With 5:46 to play and the majority of the frigid cold air leaving the stadium, the Wolverines opened their next drive with a Haynes four-yard gain.</p><p> Underwood handed the ball back to Haynes, who picked up another four yards, setting up a third down and two from the Spartans’ 44-yard line.</p><p>Haynes gained three yards to move the sticks.</p><p>The Wolverines called a play-action pass, and Underwood
