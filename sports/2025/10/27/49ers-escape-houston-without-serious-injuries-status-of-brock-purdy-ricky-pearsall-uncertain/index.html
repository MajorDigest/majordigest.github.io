    <p>Quarterback Brock Purdy and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall Jr. are getting closer to taking the field for the 49ers, but coach Kyle Shanahan Monday stopped short of saying they&#8217;d be ready to face the New York Giants in Week 9.</p>
<p>Purdy last played on Sept. 28 in a 26-21 loss to Jacksonville, aggravating a case of right turf toe which he sustained in the opener against Seattle. Mac Jones, who has started the last four games for the 49ers at quarterback and six overall, is &#8220;day to day&#8221; with a knee contusion.</p>
<p>Asked in a conference call with Bay Area writers if Purdy was a &#8220;longshot&#8221; to face the Giants, Shanahan said, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s too early to say. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a longshot but he&#8217;s doing better and we&#8217;ll see how he&#8217;s doing Wednesday. Hopefully, if he&#8217;s doing some good, he&#8217;ll get in some reps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shanahan reiterated that the playing surface at MetLife Stadium &#8212; considered one of the most unforgiving in the league &#8212; would be no factor as to whether or not Purdy would play.</p>
<p>Pearsall, who was one of the 49ers best playmakers with 20 receptions and a 16.4 yards per reception average through four games, has also been out since the Jacksonville game.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s doing better this week than last week, but I haven&#8217;t been told when he&#8217;ll be back,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to evaluate that when we get to Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 49ers lost 26-15 to Houston Sunday to fall to 5-3, and the game was more one-sided than the score indicated. The Giants fell to 2-6 with a 38-20 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, left guard Ben Bartch, out since Week 2 with a high ankle sprain, will have his practice window opened Wednesday. The 49ers will then have three weeks to determine when he&#8217;s ready to play before putting him on the 53-man roster.</p>
<p>Rookie Connor Colby, a seventh-round draft pick out of Iowa, has started in his place. Colby played 27 snaps against Houston before giving way to Nick Zakelj.</p>
<p>While Shanahan indicated Friday that wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk (ACL/MCL rehab) was a possibility to have his practice window opened from the Physically Unable to Perform list, it appears that is still at least a week away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s week to week from here on out,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;I think it would have surprised me if it was this week, but that was me just saying that every week he&#8217;s getting closer to having a chance, just not this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 49ers, meanwhile, will go forward without some of their best players until medically cleared. George Kittle, who has been back for two games after a week-opening hamstring strain, talked about the injury issues following the loss in Houston.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love playing with Ricky. He&#8217;s so full of energy and love for the game,&#8221; Kittle said Sunday. &#8220;You guys know how I feel about Brock. He&#8217;s the best operator of this offense I&#8217;ve ever seen. And then there&#8217;s Aiyuk. We paid him $30 million (per season) for a reason, because that’s how good he is.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can daydream and think about that stuff, and I can’t wait to start playing with those guys again. But currently we’re playing with what we’ve got, and I think what we’ve got can win football games.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones has been adamant about preparing as the starter whether he&#8217;s starting or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;My process isn’t going to change I’m going to come into work and follow my schedule and I do that whether we win or lose,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;I’ve played a lot of different roles in this league.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news for the 49ers is that all three players who left the Houston game due to injury and did not return &#8212; linebacker Dee Winters (knee), defensive tackle Jordan Elliott (ankle) and defensive end Sam Okuayinonu (ankle) &#8212; are all day to day and could practice and face the Giants. Defensive tackle Alfred Collins is also day to day with a shoulder injury.</p>
<p>Center Jake Brendel and Bryce Huff, both of whom didn&#8217;t face Houston because of hamstring strains, are likely out another week at least, Shanahan said.</p>


<p>Jones was disturbed with some of the mental mistakes made against the Texans, more than the physical.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can live with post-snap mistakes, like if we have a drop or I don’t throw a good pass, but if I’m not looking in the right spot or people are running the wrong routes, then you have no chance,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;I feel like we have a veteran group. We’ve got to get back in the ring and keep fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shanahan said there were errors of both the mental and physical variety against the Texans.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were definitely mental errors, not more than usual or anything like that, but in that type of game, every single play was a huge deal with the lack of number of plays (on offense),&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;Any mistakes that were made were extremely magnified.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even with Winters unable to finish the Houston game, third-round pick Nick Martin didn&#8217;t get off the sideline to play defense. Instead, veteran Curtis Robinson wound up playing.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s behind Curtis in that pecking order,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;It depends on how these practices go. He&#8217;s been up these last two weeks, he&#8217;s done real good on special teams. I think he&#8217;s coming along fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212; The 49ers are out of elevations for defensive end Trevis Gipson, who has been flexed three times to play on game day. The 49ers will need to promote him to the 53-man roster in order to play because practice squad players can be elevated only three times. The same goes for wide receiver/special teams player Malik Turner.</p>
<p>&#8212; Shanahan said he is encouraged by the progress of Demarcus Robinson, a training camp standout who had his progress slowed by a three-game suspension to start the year for being in violation of the NFL&#8217;s personal conduct policy during the offseason.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think he&#8217;s getting back there and he did some good things yesterday,&#8221; Shanahan said.</p>

<p>A look at who played and how much in the loss to Houston:</p>
<p><strong>80:</strong> Malik Mustapha played every snap at safety, his most work since returning from ACL rehab. Also staying on the field way too long for every snap were inside linebacker Tatum Bethune, safety Ji&#8217;Ayir Brown and cornerbacks Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green.</p>
<p><strong>54:</strong> Rookie Alfred Collins got the most snaps of anyone on the defensive line, one more than Mykel Williams.</p>
<p><strong>48:</strong> Center Matt Hennessy, in for starter Jake Brendel (hamstring) played every offensive snap along with right tackle Colton McKivitz, right guard Dominic Puni, left tackle Trent Williams and Jones at quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>41:</strong> Jauan Jennings got the most snaps of any wide receiver, three more than Kendrick Bourne.</p>
<p><strong>35:</strong> Defensive end Robert Beal J. had never played more than 21 snaps in a game since his rookie season in 2023. He had four tackles and another on special teams but generated little if any pressure on Stroud.</p>
<p><strong>46:</strong> Christian McCaffrey was off the field for just two snaps.</p>
<p><strong>22:</strong> When Winters departed, Curtis Robinson assumed the weakside linebacker role over Martin. Martin played 10 snaps on special teams.</p>
<p><strong>19:</strong> Nick Zakelj was a standard practice squad elevation who subbed for starter Connor Colby at left guard, his most playing time since getting 64 and 76 snaps as a starter in his last two games in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>6:</strong> Rookie fourth-round pick Jordan Watkins made his debut at wide receiver and made his first NFL catch for a 7-yard gain.</p>
<p><strong>5:</strong> Jake Tonges had a season low in snaps &#8212; he has 13 in the last two games since Kittle&#8217;s return &#8212; but had his fourth touchdown reception of the season on a Jones pass that was intended for Kittle. Fellow reserve tight end Luke Farrell played just three snaps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mac told me he was throwing it to me,&#8221; Kittle said. &#8220;Jake has sticky fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>0:</strong> Marques Sigle came in to the game having played 377 snaps including playing 100 percent of the snaps in his first five games as a rookie starter at safety. He finished the game still having played 377 snaps. He did play 23 snaps on special teams.</p>
