<p><em><strong>CHECK IT OUT</strong>: WGN-TV's Mike Lowe took a look at "the tale of two touchdowns" from the storied Loyola Academy-Mt. Carmel rivalry — two controversial plays that unfolded in the same corner of the same end zone at Sachs Stadium. Click <strong>HERE</strong> to watch.</em></p>



<p>Two powerhouse Chicagoland high school football programs are going into the Illinois High School Association playoffs with a chance at a historic state title four-peat.</p>



<p>But by the end of this weekend, only one will still have that chance.</p>



<p>In what surely has to be one of the most significant first-round matchups in IHSA state football playoff history, longtime rivals Chicago Mt. Carmel and Loyola Academy of Wilmette square off at 4:30 p.m. Saturday in the Class 8A bracket, which has the state's largest programs.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>The game is at Mt. Carmel's Barda-Dowling Stadium at Carey Field, located on Chicago's Southeast Side. It will also be a rematch from last week's regular-season finale, when Mt. Carmel notched a 35-24 win in Wilmette in Chicago Catholic League action.</p>



<p>Both teams enter the IHSA playoffs having won three consecutive state titles, but in different classes.</p>



<p>Mt. Carmel won the Class 7A championship each of the last three seasons before moving up to Class 8A this season. Loyola has won three straight Class 8A championships and is trying to become the first program in IHSA history to win four straight in one class.</p>



<p>But the Ramblers have not followed an easy path this season. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Loyola graduated 14 starters from last season's state title team and has relied on sophomores at many key positions this season</p>



<p>After starting out ranked No. 2 in the Sun-Times Preseason Super 25, they tumbled out of the rankings, finishing the regular season with a 4-4 record. That meant the Ramblers didn't gain automatic playoff eligibility, which requires five wins (they only played eight regular-season games because they were unable to find a Week 2 opponent).</p>



<p>However, Loyola managed to sneak into the 32-team Class 8A playoff field as the No. 32 seed due to playoff points and the results of other Week 9 games around the state.</p>



<p>Mt. Carmel, on the other hand, had no such issues during the regular season. The Caravan went 9-0 and enter the playoffs ranked No. 1 in the Sun-Times Super 25. They're also ranked No. 1 in the state and No. 42 nationally in the On3.com State Composite Rankings.</p>



<p>The amount of talent on the Caravan roster this season is staggering. In a preseason preview story, Sun-Times preps reporter Michael O'Brien called it "probably the greatest collection of high-level talent ever seen on an area high school football team."</p>



<p>That includes eight players with scholarship offers to NCAA Power 5 programs, O'Brien reports: Joey Quinn (DL), Roman Igwebuike (LB), Braeden Jones (DL), Tavares Harrington (DB), Caleb Tucker (DL), Quentin Burrell (WR), Marshaun Thornton (WR) and Claude Mpouma (OL).</p>



<p>After its undefeated regular season, Mt. Carmel earned the No. 1 seed in the Class 8A playoff field when the pairings were announced this past Saturday night after the regular season concluded.</p>



<p>First-round games among all eight classes will be played Friday and Saturday, then the 16 teams remaining in each class advance to the second round on Friday, Nov. 7, and Saturday, Nov. 8.</p>



<p>The eight IHSA state championship games will be held Friday, Nov. 28, and Saturday, Nov. 29, at Illinois State University's Hancock Stadium in Normal.</p>



<p>Here are this weekend's first-round matchups around the state, along with a glance at the full playoff brackets. Visit ihsa.org for completion playoff football information.</p>
