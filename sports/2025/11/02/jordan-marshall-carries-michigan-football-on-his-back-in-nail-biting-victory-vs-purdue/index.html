The ball traveled 37 yards and bounced.</p><p>Browne completed a pass to Harris for two yards before connecting with Jackson III for a 15-yard gain to move the sticks.</p><p>Browne hit EJ Horton for a five-yard gain before Harris gained two yards on his second carry of the game.</p><p>On third and three, Browne got to the edge and bounced outside for a 20-yard gain to the Michigan 22-yard line.</p><p>Harris followed up with a three-yard gain before Browne was hit by Moore, forcing the ball to come out of his hands funny.</p><p>As the ball fluttered in the air and nearly got picked, the ball fell to the ground and was recovered by <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Rayshaun_Benny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Rayshaun_Benny/"><b>Rayshaun Benny</b></a> on the Wolverines’ 28-yard line.</p><p>Moore was having a heck of a game as he recorded his second sack of the quarter, resulting in a strip and recovery for the first turnover of the game.</p><p>Underwood was sacked for a one-yard loss on first down before Jordan Marshall carried the ball for a five-yard gain.</p><p>On third down and six, Underwood threw an incomplete pass out of the outstretched hands of wide receiver Donaven McCulley, who fell into the bench of the opposing team.</p><p>Hollenbeck punted the ball after the Wolverines’ second three-and-out for 50 yards, which was fair caught by Jackson III at the Purdue 18-yard line.</p><p>Michigan’s offense looked out of sync to start the game as Underwood was all over the place with his passes in the first quarter.</p><p>On their third possession of the quarter, running back Malachi Thomas carried the ball for a two-yard gain.</p><p>Browne completed a pass to Thomas on a running back screen play, but got blown up by <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Ernest_Hausmann/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Ernest Hausmann</b></a> for a loss of six yards.</p><p>After the punt to the Wolverines’ 21-yard line, Underwood completed a pass to Jordan Marshall for 25 yards before dialing home on a big run of 54 yards for the first touchdown of the game.</p><p>The scoring drive covered two plays for 79 yards in 18 seconds and was capped off by kicker <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Dominic_Zvada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Dominic_Zvada/"><b>Dominic Zvada</b></a>’s extra point, taking a 7-0 lead with 1:25 remaining in the quarter.</p><p>Purdue got the ball on their 25-yard line after the kickoff, and Browne completed a pass to Tuggle for a six-yard gain.</p><p>On second down and four, Harris carried the ball for four yards to pick up the first down, setting up a first and 10.</p><p>Harris got the pigskin again, this time for a five-yard gain to end the quarter at the 40-yard line.</p><p>The first quarter was dominated by Derrick Moore, who had two sacks and a forced fumble to keep the Boilermakers off the board.</p><p>Jordan Marshall finally got going as he broke an extended passing play for 25 yards before making a house call for 54 yards down the Michigan sideline to get the fans back into the game.</p><h3>2nd quarter</h3><p>Purdue opened the quarter on second down and five with a handoff to Thomas for a two-yard gain.</p><p>On third and three, Thomas broke the line of scrimmage with an eight-yard carry to the 50-yard line to move the sticks.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Troy_Bowles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Troy_Bowles/"><b>Troy Bowles</b></a> got into the game, stopping Tuggle’s seven-yard catch and run.</p><p>On second and three, Browne handed the ball off to Thomas for a four-yard gain.</p><p>With a fresh set of downs, Browne escaped the pocket but was assisted as the lineman was called for holding, losing 10 yards on the play.</p><p>On first and 20, Browne hit EJ Horton Jr. for a six-yard catch and run.</p><p>With second and 14 in their sights, Harris toted the rock for a five-yard gain before Horton Jr. picked up seven yards, setting up a fourth and two.</p><p>On fourth down and two, Purdue went for it on the 31-yard line and hit a wide-open Tuggle for four yards to gain a first down.</p><p>With a fresh set of downs, the Boilermakers snapped the ball to Singleton, who kept the ball for a five-yard gain.</p><p>Singleton kept the ball again for a 13-yard gain down to the Michigan nine-yard line.</p><p>Purdue got tricky and connected on a trick play for a wide-open touchdown, but the play was called back due to an ineligible player downfield.</p><p>After receiving a gift, Michigan’s defense stopped Harris on first down for a two-yard gain.</p><p>On second and eight, Browne handed the ball off again to Thomas for a one-yard loss.</p><p>With third and nine from the nine-yard line, Browne drew a defender offside before throwing incomplete in the endzone, which also drew a foul for pass interference, setting up a new set of downs.</p><p>The penalty was called on <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jyaire_Hill/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Jyaire Hill</b></a>.</p><p>On first and goal, Purdue capped off their quarter-opening drive with a touchdown by Harris for two yards.</p><p>Purdue covered 75 yards in 16 plays, eating up 9:30 on the game clock.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wink_Martindale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wink_Martindale/"><b>Wink Martindale</b></a>’s defense gave up potentially their longest drive of the season as Purdue ate up a lot of clock in the quarter.</p><p>Marsh returned the kickoff 20 yards to the 20-yard line to an ultra-quiet crowd that did not like what they were seeing from their football team.</p><p>The offense and defense looked like they were playing down to their competition as Purdue tied the game with 6:49 to play in the quarter.</p><p>Purdue moved the ball up and down the field on Michigan’s defense while the Wolverines’ offense looked sluggish and out of sync early in the game.</p><p>Jordan Marshall opened the drive with a six-yard carry that nearly could’ve gone to the house if not for a shoelace tackle.</p><p>Underwood kept the ball on second and four, scrambling for a five-yard gain to move the sticks.</p><p>Underwood rolled out to the right to hit Marsh for a 20-yard catch.</p><p>He then completed a pass to tight end <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Deakon_Tonielli/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Deakon Tonielli</b></a><b> </b>for four yards before handing the ball off to Jordan Marshall for a two-yard gain.</p><p>On third and four, Underwood hit Zack Marshall for a five-yard gain to move the sticks.</p><p>Jordan Marshall picked up three yards on first down before throwing incomplete to McCulley, who fell incomplete in the endzone.</p><p>It looked like McCulley didn’t track the ball at all on the play.</p><p>Sensing urgency, Underwood eluded the pocket and made a defender miss before gaining 12 yards on the play to the amazement of the crowd.</p><p>Underwood went 5-9 through nearly two quarters for 54 yards as the passing attack was awful thus far.</p><p>But he and Jordan Marshall led the rushing attack for a combined 104 yards before <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jasper_Parker/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jasper_Parker/"><b>Jasper Parker</b></a> got his first carry of the game for four yards.</p><p>Underwood threw another incompletion as tight end Marlin Klein had a wide-open touchdown, but never saw the ball as he ran up the right sideline.</p><p>Trying to make a play, Underwood eluded the pocket and threw an interception to Hudauri Hines on what looked to be his best pass of the game, hitting the defender right in the numbers with 1:59 to play.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Sherrone_Moore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Sherrone_Moore/"><b>Sherrone Moore</b></a> and his team found themselves in a dog fight early as Underwood’s pick took points off the board.</p><p>After the interception at the five-yard line, Browne handed the ball off to Thomas for a three-yard gain.</p><p>On second down and seven, Browne handed the ball off again to Thomas, who picked up two yards before Michigan called their first timeout of the half with 1:08 to play.</p><p>With four yards to go, Purdue, on third down, drew up a passing play which fell incomplete, setting up a shanked punt that went out of bounds on the Wolverines’ 32-yard line.</p><p>The ball went 22 yards, placing Michigan directly in field goal range before the half.</p><p>Underwood took the snap and threw a medicine ball in the direction of wide receiver <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Semaj_Morgan/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Semaj Morgan,</b></a> who got clobbered by the defender in the air.</p><p>Marshall gained nine yards on second down before Underwood linked up with Klein for 10 yards before the men in maize called their second timeout of the half.</p><p>Underwood kept the ball for a 10-yard rush up the gut down to the three-yard line before he handed the ball off to Marshall for a three-yard touchdown with 17 seconds to play.</p><p>Zvada knocked in the extra point, capping off a five-play, 32-yard drive in 41 seconds to take a 14-7 lead.</p><p>Purdue got the kickoff, and Jackson III returned the ball to the 35-yard line with 11 seconds to play.</p><p>Browne took a knee to end the dreadful first half, as Purdue had the ball for over 19 minutes while Michigan had the ball for over 10 minutes.</p><p>The only good thing about that half was that it lasted only an hour and 30 minutes, since the game was moving pretty quickly.</p><p>Underwood ended the half, completing 6-13 for 64 yards and an interception, while the Wolverines’ defense gave up only 70 yards passing and 85 yards rushing</p><p>Jordan Marshall had nine carries for 91 yards and one reception for 25 yards to lead the team in both categories through 30 minutes of game action.</p><p>Underwood had five carries for 34 yards, but took some pretty big hits in the process.</p><p>Michigan fans would like to see him slide moving forward.</p><h3>3rd quarter</h3><p>Leading 14-7, Marsh started the second half, fumbling the ball before returning the ball 14 yards to the 14-yard line.</p><p>On their first possession of the half, in front of a cold, quiet stadium, Jordan Marshall gained one yard.</p><p>Underwood nearly threw an interception on second down to McCulley, who picked up five yards on the play.</p><p>Underwood, on third down and four, connected with Browder, who dropped the ball, leading to another three-and-out and a Hollenbeck punt.</p><p>Browne completed a pass to Jackson III for 19 yards. If he had kept his feet, he would have scored on the play.</p><p>He connected with Horton for 10 yards to drive the ball down the field before running for two yards on first down.</p><p>On second and eight, Browne handed the ball off to Thomas, who lost one yard on the play.</p><p>Browne kept the ball on a scramble play, eluding Michigan defenders to pick up 10 yards on the play.</p><p>With the ball on the 24-yard line, Browne threw incomplete to Harris down the left sideline.</p><p>On second down and 10, Harris toted the rock for a one-yard gain, setting up a third and nine on the 23-yard line.</p><p>With the crowd getting back into the game, Browne eluded the sack but threw the ball out of bounds, only there was no receiver in the area, costing the team nine yards on the play.</p><p>With the ball moved back to the 50-yard line, Purdue kicker Spencer Porath drilled a 50-yard field goal to cut into the deficit, trailing 14-10 with nine minutes to play in the quarter.</p><p>Purdue’s defense is stopping Michigan’s offense thus far in the game, while their offense continued to move the ball on the Wolverines’ defense.</p><p>Sensing their passing attack was not in sync, Purdue started loading the box as Jordan Marshall gained one yard to open the possession.</p><p>On second and nine, Underwood connected with <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Channing_Goodwin/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Channing Goodwin</b></a> for 12 yards before hitting Marsh for eight yards.</p><p>Jordan Marshall picked up seven yards to move the sticks before catching a medicine ball as the defender nearly blew up the play, taking Marsh down on a wide receiver pass for a three-yard loss.</p><p>On second and 13, Jordan Marshall picked up three yards to get the Wolverines back on schedule.</p><p>But on third and 13, Underwood threw an incomplete pass down the middle of the field before Hollenbeck shanked another punt, which rolled down to the Purdue 18-yard line.</p><p>It was later reported that the punt was partially blocked as Purdue had the ball on their own 18-yard line, trailing 14-10 with 5:30 to play in the quarter.</p><p>Browne threw incomplete in the direction of Christian Earls on first down.</p><p>On second and 10 with their backs to their own endzone, Browne threw another incomplete pass, due to it being tipped at the line.</p><p>Browne took off on a quarterback draw for four yards, setting up for a punt to Morgan, who caught the ball and ran backwards for a two-yard loss as the ball was placed on the Michigan 30-yard line.</p><p>The punt went 42 yards in the air, changing field position.</p><p>The Michigan faithful needed a spark of some sort as the offense couldn’t move the ball through the air.</p><p>Purdue started forcing Underwood, the high-priced quarterback, to make plays with his arm, but the receivers and he were out of sync.</p><p>With the ball, following the punt, Underwood completed a short-yardage pass to Klein, who got hit hard out of bounds after a six-yard gain.</p><p>Purdue got called for a blind side block, moving the ball an extra 15 yards.</p><p>The
