<p>Normally, if the No. 1 overall seed squeaks by the No. 32 overall seed, the last in the bracket, in the first round of the Illinois High School Association Class 8A state football playoffs, there might be some cause for alarm.</p>



<p>Well, not in this case.</p>



<p>In a historic first-round matchup between longtime Chicago Catholic League rivals and state powerhouse programs that both entered the playoffs trying for a fourth straight IHSA state title, No. 1 seed and top-ranked Chicago Mount Carmel hosted No. 32 seed Loyola Academy of Wilmette on Saturday afternoon at Barda-Dowling Stadium at Carey Field on the South Side.</p>



<p>Loyola, playing as a rare underdog, led 14-0 late in the first half and still held a three-point lead about midway through the fourth quarter. That's when Mount Carmel quarterback Emmett Dowling connected with receiver Marshaun Thornton over the middle, and Thornton raced the rest of the way for a go-ahead, 92-yard touchdown.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

<p>The Caravan held on for a 21-17 win to stay undefeated at 10-0 and advance to the second round this weekend, keeping their hopes for a historic four-peat alive while ending the Ramblers' bid to do the same.</p>



<p>You can read the full game story from the Chicago Sun-Times' Michael O'Brien HERE.</p>



<p>It was a first-round matchup you'd normally expect to see in the state title game or maybe the state semifinals. </p>



<p>Mount Carmel won the last three Class 7A state titles before moving up to Class 8A, IHSA's largest class, this season. Loyola had won the last three Class 8A state titles and was trying to become the first team in IHSA state football history to win four straight in one class.</p>



<p>Mount Carmel, loaded with a roster that includes eight players with scholarship offers to NCAA Power 5 programs, went through the regular season as expected. The Caravan remain at No. 1 in the Sun-Times Super 25. They've also moved up two spots, to No. 40 nationally, in the On3.com State Composite Rankings.</p>



<p>Loyola, on the other hand, had to replace a number of key players from last year's team that completed a state title three-peat. Relying on a number of sophomores, the Ramblers went 4-4 during the regular season and just snuck into the Class 8A playoff field as the final seed.</p>



<p>But a program like that is always dangerous, and Loyola proved Saturday that had it gotten by Mount Carmel, it may well have been the favorite among the 16 teams left in the Class 8A field.</p>



<p>"They are not a four-win team,’’ Mount Carmel linebacker Stephen Winkler told the Sun-Times. "They are a legit football team. ... They played hard. We came out a little flat at the start, but we came through when it mattered."</p>



<p>The Caravan continue their run at history with a second-round game at 4 p.m. Saturday against No. 17 seed Belleville East, which will host the game.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brother Rice cruises</h3>



<p>Meanwhile, in the Class 7A field, No. 6 seed Chicago Brother Rice cruised to a 57-0 first-round win over No. 27 seed Rockford Jefferson.</p>



<p>Brother Rice improved to 9-1 and advanced to the second round to play at No. 22 seed Algonquin Jacobs (7-3) at 6 p.m. Saturday.</p>



<p>Despite getting the No. 6 seed in the Class 7A field, Brother Rice is ranked No. 2 behind Mount Carmel in the Sun-Times Super 25 and No. 3 (No. 104 nationally) in the On3.com State Composite rankings.</p>
