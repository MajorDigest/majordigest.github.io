remaining.</p><p>Stone got called for intentional grounding, but regained the yards with a 32-yard catch by Wilde.</p><p>He then completed a four-yard pass to Hayden Eligon II to end the quarter.</p><p>Before the fourth quarter began, three former Wildcat quarterbacks led the crowd in a sing-along to “Take me out to the ballgame.”</p><h3>4th quarter</h3><p>Stone completed a pass of three yards to Wagner before hitting Eligon II down the sideline for a 22-yard gain.</p><p>He then found Welcing down the middle of the field for a 22-yard gain, which went down to the one-yard
