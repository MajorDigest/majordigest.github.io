    <p>World-class boxing will take place at the historic <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Fox_Theatre/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Fox_Theatre/"><b>Fox Theatre</b></a> for a second time this year, featuring Detroit’s own former junior middleweight world champion Tony “Super Bad” Harrison against Brian Damian Chaves on Dec. 20.</p><p>Headlining the event, Olivia Curry (7-2-2, 2 KOs) and Kaye Scott (4-1-1) look to settle unfinished business in a highly anticipated ten-round rematch for the WBC and WBA Unified Middleweight World Championship. </p><p>Harrison (30-4-1, 21 KOs), the charismatic and popular former world champion continues his return to the top, taking on Argentina’s Brian Damian Chaves (15-7, 6 KOs) in a ten-round middleweight showdown.</p><p>Undefeated heavyweight Pryce Taylor of Brooklyn, NY (9-0, 6 KOs) will face Michael Coffie (13-5, 10 KOs) in an eight-round contest.</p><p>The event promoted by <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Salita_Promotions/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Salita_Promotions/"><b>Salita Promotions</b></a> and sponsored by M Select Luxury Water, will stream live on boxing streaming service, DAZN. </p><p>“We are excited to return to one of the most iconic venues in the country, the historic Fox Theatre in Detroit, for an electric night of boxing, ” said Dmitriy Salita. “The main event — Curry vs. Scott II — is a legitimate Fight of the Year rematch with WBC and WBA world titles on the line.</p><p>“Detroit’s last world champion, Tony Harrison, continues his comeback, and we have a compelling American heavyweight showdown as rising undefeated prospect Pryce Taylor takes on his toughest test in the dangerous and battle-tested Michael Coffie. The non-televised undercard will showcase top local and national talent in competitive matchups. Big Time Boxing USA is built on meaningful fights in historic venues, and this final event of the year will deliver high-level action live on DAZN from one of boxing’s great homes — Fox Theatre in Detroit.”</p><p>Chicago’s Olivia Curry and Australia’s Kaye Scott wrote one of the most unforgettable chapters in the women’s middleweight division this past summer when they went to war inside Detroit’s famed Fox Theatre on Sept. 19. </p><p>Widely regarded as a top contender for Fight of the Year, their clash delivered ten rounds of nonstop action, a brutal, beautiful display of heart and skill as Curry and Scott traded punches in one of 2025’s most electrifying women’s world title bouts.</p><p>The fight ended in a majority draw (scores: 98-92 for Scott, 95-95 twice), leaving both the WBC and WBA Middleweight World Titles vacant and fans clamoring for a rematch. </p><p>Now, just three months later, the rivals return to finish what they started — this time, with one mission in mind: to leave Detroit as the Unified Middleweight World Champion.</p><p>“A draw is always an unsatisfying result for something you’ve worked so hard for, ” said Curry. “Of course I wanted to win, I put so much work into preparing for that fight, but after watching the fight back, I think it was a fair decision. Credit to Kaye, she fought in a way we hadn’t really seen on tape from her before, using that amateur-style volume. I landed the harder shots, but I gave up too much time in between those moments. This time, I’m making small adjustments, staying sharp, and not letting her control the pace. I came into the first fight too polite, just happy to be on the big stage. This time, I’m coming in with bad intentions. It’s not worth bleeding on the canvas for anything less than those belts.”</p><p>“The Fox Theatre is so beautiful, and being back there means a lot to me. My dad grew up around Detroit, and my grandmother actually wrote letters about going to the movies at the Fox in the 1940s. Knowing that makes it feel like I’m fighting in a piece of my own family history. Thank you to everyone involved for making this fight happen”</p><p>“I know I won that last fight with Olivia Curry and this time I’m not leaving the ring without those belts,” said Scott. “I’ve never been more focused and determined in my life. I can’t wait to put on a show on December 20. Thanks to Salita Promotions, WBC and WBA for supporting us. This will be a great night for women’s boxing.”</p><p>Adding to the excitement, Detroit native Harrison looks to extend his comeback momentum after an exciting middleweight debut and victory over Edward Diaz on July 27 at <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Little_Caesars_Arena/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Little_Caesars_Arena/"><b>Little Caesars Arena</b></a> as part of the <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Claressa_Shields/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Claressa_Shields/"><b>Claressa Shields</b></a> vs. Lani Daniels co-main event. </p><p>Despite a late knockdown scare in the ninth, Harrison controlled the action with his signature jab and earned a unanimous decision win (98-91, 97-92, 93-93), reigniting his quest for another world title shot.</p><p>Argentina’s Brian “El Elegante” Chaves (15-7, 6 KOs) enters Detroit riding the momentum of a dominant TKO victory over Matías Raimundo Díaz. </p><p>In that bout, Chaves showcased his trademark aggression, pressing forward from the opening bell, forcing Díaz to take a standing count in the third round before the referee halted the action. The Buenos Aires native, who was deducted a point early in round two, turned the fight into a statement performance, reminding fans of his relentless pressure and inside-fighting power. </p><p>With years of international experience across South America and Europe, Chaves now looks to carry that intensity as he faces former world champion Tony Harrison in a pivotal co-feature bout.</p><p>“I feel great coming back, ” said Harrison. “I was put on this earth to fight. It’s been about twelve years since I fought at home, and to have my last two fights here in Detroit is a dream come true. I told Salita, ‘Just drive the car — I’ll be the shooter.’ He’s doing his job, and I’ll do mine. Soon enough, we’ll be in a bigger fight again and shock the world. To do it at the Fox Theatre is special. I’m Tony Ruffin, and this is an iconic run for me — in one of the most iconic places in Detroit. Welcome to the best boxing city in the world.”</p><p>Also joining the DAZN telecast is rising heavyweight prospect Pryce Taylor, who returns following his dominant eight-round shutout over Robert Simms on the same Shields vs. Daniels card. </p><p>Known for his punishing body attack and composure beyond his years, Taylor continues his unbeaten run against proven veteran Michael Coffie, a dangerous test for the Brooklyn native’s next step toward world title contention.</p><p>“I can’t wait to fight in Detroit again, ” stated Taylor. “That’s my favorite place to fight. I love being booed because I’m not from there, but it doesn’t matter. I’m still going to put on the show and win. They aren’t in the ring. I’m in the ring. And I’m putting on an entertaining show.</p><p>“The fans want to see a knockout, but at the end of the day, you can’t knock out everybody. Different people deserve different approaches. This fight is going to be a different fight because I’m fighting a different person, so based on his fighting style, you’re going to see how I fight. I fight accordingly. All that matters is can he fight? And I don’t think he can fight. Not at my level, anyway.”</p><p>The event marks another milestone in ‘Big Time Boxing USA’ dedication to Detroit’s boxing resurgence, uniting future stars on one unforgettable night.</p><p>Comerica Bank is the exclusive presenting partner of the Fox Theatre.
