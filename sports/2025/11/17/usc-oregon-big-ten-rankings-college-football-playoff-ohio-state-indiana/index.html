    <p><em>The Big Ten power rankings will be published weekly throughout the regular season using a mix of data-driven insight and unapologetic subjectivity. With 18 teams, nine conference games and wild variations in the quality of non-conference schedules, comparative analysis is an inherently flawed approach. Which is fine, because the Hotline hasn’t been wrong about anything in at least 90 minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>(Last week’s rankings are here.)</em></p>

<p>From social media to legacy media and all shouting points in between, USC&#8217;s hotly anticipated trip to Oregon this week has been billed as a College Football Playoff elimination game.</p>
<p>The Hotline isn&#8217;t convinced the situation is as clean and clear as it might appear.</p>
<p>For the Ducks, this old-school Pac-12 showdown certainly carries a win-or-go-home feel. Given their placement in last week&#8217;s CFP rankings (No. 8), they likely would drop below the threshold for an at-large berth with a loss.</p>
<p>For the Trojans, the stakes aren&#8217;t as easy to define.</p>
<p>A loss would be their third of the season and knock them out of the playoff race &#8212; of that, there is zero doubt.</p>
<p>But would success in Autzen Stadium, combined with a victory over UCLA in the season finale, guarantee the Trojans a berth in the CFP?</p>
<p>Not according to the entity that matters most: The CFP selection committee, which has been signaling for two weeks that USC (8-2) is a fringe candidate.</p>
<p>After all, the Trojans were No. 19 in the initial rankings, well below two-loss teams from the Big 12 (Utah) and SEC (Texas, Oklahoma and Vanderbilt) and one spot behind a two-loss team from the muddled ACC (Miami).</p>
<p>The second CFP rankings weren&#8217;t much better for USC, which improved to No. 17 &#8212; once again behind a slew of two-loss teams from the other power conferences.</p>
<p>Would a victory in Eugene catapult the Trojans into the top 10, the likely cut line for one of the seven at-large berths?</p>
<p>Our skepticism has increased over time due to results elsewhere (e.g., Oklahoma&#8217;s win at Alabama and Notre Dame&#8217;s victory at Pittsburgh) and a closer look at the committee&#8217;s assessment of Oregon (9-1).</p>
<p>The Ducks were No. 9 in the initial rankings, three spots below their placement in the AP poll, and moved up just one position after a road victory over a ranked opponent, Iowa.</p>
<p>Of course, the Hawkeyes might not be ranked this week after losing for the fourth time (at USC), which would leave Oregon with an 0-1 record against Top 25 opponents &#8212; that loss coming at home, in decisive fashion, to Indiana.</p>
<p>If the Trojans win Saturday, don&#8217;t be surprised if the Ducks lose more ground than USC gains in the CFP rankings next week.</p>
<p>One reason for the limited upside: The Trojans have two potentially immovable obstacles in their path, No. 9 Notre Dame, which beat USC head-to-head, and No. 15 Miami, which beat Notre Dame head-to-head.</p>
<p>The great leap upward many USC fans would expect following a victory in Eugene may not materialize.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a loss could end Oregon&#8217;s playoff push. The Ducks are closer to the cut line than the safe zone right now. Losing to a lower-ranked team would be immensely damaging and create the distinct possibility that Oregon finishes the season with no victories over ranked opponents.</p>
<p>In theory, and perhaps practice, the two-loss Ducks would be behind USC and Notre Dame, plus Alabama and BYU and all the undefeated and one-loss teams in the Big Ten, SEC and Big 12.</p>
<p>The CFP is ultimately a numbers game. The math looks bleak for the losing team Saturday afternoon, and it might not be all that favorable for the winner.</p>
<p>To the power rankings &#8230;</p>
<p><em>(All times Pacific)</em></p>
<h3>1. Ohio State (10-0/7-0)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> beat UCLA 48-10<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Rutgers (9 a.m. on Fox)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> Notable that quarterback Julian Sayin is the No. 2 betting favorite to win the Heisman Trophy (2/1) considering he&#8217;s the fourth-best player on his own team, if that, behind receiver Jeremiah Smith, safety Caleb Downs and linebacker Arvell Reese. Mostly, what it says is the Buckeyes are absolutely loaded. <em>(Previous: 1)</em></p>
<h3>2. Indiana (11-0/8-0)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> beat Wisconsin 31-7<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> idle<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> The Big Ten has been, without question, the least interesting Power Four conference this season with its top-heavy structure and Indiana and Ohio State not playing so many of the higher-level teams. <em>(Previous: 2)</em></p>
<h3>3. Oregon (9-1/6-1)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> beat Minnesota 42-13<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. USC (12:30 p.m. on CBS)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> It will be like old times in Eugene with the Trojans visiting for a high-stakes matchup and ESPN&#8217;s &#8220;College GameDay&#8221; airing live &#8212; except that USC and Oregon missed each other regularly after the Pac-12 added divisions. This will mark the Trojans&#8217; third appearance in Autzen Stadium in the last 14 years. <em>(Previous: 3)</em></p>
<h3>4. USC (8-2/6-1)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> beat Iowa 26-21<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Oregon (12:30 p.m. on CBS)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> The issue isn&#8217;t that USC has proven it can play so-called Big Ten football with wins over Iowa, Nebraska and Michigan. It&#8217;s that the Trojans were so ill-equipped for the mission when they joined the conference. They should never be shorthanded at the line of scrimmage &#8212; all Lincoln Riley and Co. have done is return to the program&#8217;s historical standard. <em>(Previous: 4)</em></p>
<h3>5. Michigan (8-2/6-1)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> won at Northwestern 24-22<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Maryland (1 p.m. on Big Ten Network)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> Trap game, thy name is Maryland. <em>(Previous: 5)</em></p>
<h3>6. Iowa (6-4/4-3)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost at USC 26-21<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Michigan State (12:30 p.m. on FS1)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> When you have one victory over a team with a winning record and that team is Minnesota (6-4), your season is indisputably mediocre. <em>(Previous: 6)</em></p>
<h3>7. Washington (7-3/4-3)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> beat Purdue 49-13<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at UCLA (7:30 p.m. on NBC)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> The disparity between UW&#8217;s home and road performance is far greater than it should be at the end of Jedd Fisch&#8217;s second season. The situation cannot be mere happenstance and demands a deep dive during the offseason. <em>(Previous: 8)</em></p>
<h3>8. Nebraska (7-3/4-3)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> did not play<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Penn State (4 p.m. on NBC)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> 1985 called and expects a helluva game Saturday afternoon. <em>(Previous: 7)</em></p>
<h3>9. Illinois (7-3/4-3)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> beat Maryland 24-6<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Wisconsin (4:30 p.m. on Big Ten Network)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> With the trip to Madison and then a finale (at home) with Northwestern, the Illini should win nine games for the second consecutive regular season. <em>(Previous: 9)</em></p>
<h3>10. Minnesota (6-4/4-3)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost at Oregon 42-13<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Northwestern (9 a.m. on Big Ten Network)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> We totally understand the Gophers&#8217; third-rate performance. Minneapolis to Eugene is an incredibly long way to row a boat. <em>(Previous: 10)</em></p>
<h3>11. Northwestern (5-5/3-4)</h3>
<p><strong>Result: </strong>lost to Michigan 24-22<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Minnesota (9 a.m. on Big Ten Network)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> The come-from-ahead defeat to the Wolverines looks like the proverbial quality loss against a more talented opponent until you realize Northwestern was +5 in turnovers. And then it morphs into a terrible loss. <em>(Previous: 11)</em></p>
<h3>12. UCLA (3-7/3-4)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost at Ohio State 48-10<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Washington (7:30 p.m. on NBC)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> The Bruins scored more points against Ohio State than either Texas or Washington, so at least they have that going for &#8217;em. <em>(Previous: 12)</em></p>

<h3>13. Rutgers (5-5/2-5)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> did not play<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Ohio State (9 a.m. on Fox)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> Playing in Columbus on the Fox &#8220;Big Noon&#8221; broadcast is not the opportunity it might appear for the Scarlet Knights, unless their goal is to look completely overmatched. <em>(Previous: 13)</em></p>
<h3>14. Penn State (4-6/1-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> won at Michigan State 28-10<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Nebraska (4 p.m. on NBC)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> The Nittany Lions recording their first conference victory on Nov. 15 was not on our Big Ten bingo card for 2025 &#8212; or for any year in recorded history. <em>(Previous: 16)</em></p>
<h3>15. Maryland (4-6/1-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost at Illinois 24-6<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Michigan (1 p.m. on Big Ten Network)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> If you missed the news, Maryland announced coach Mike Locksley would return next season with enhanced resources &#8212; a page out of the Wisconsin playbook, it seems. <em>(Previous: 14)</em></p>
<h3>16. Michigan State (3-7/0-7)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost to Penn State 28-10<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> at Iowa (12:30 p.m. on FS1)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> Meanwhile, Michigan State&#8217;s administration has remained silent on Jonathan Smith&#8217;s future, which presumably means school officials are too busy preparing the buyout terms to issue any comment. <em>(Previous: 15)</em></p>
<h3>17. Wisconsin (3-7/1-6)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost at Indiana 31-7<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> vs. Illinois (4:30 p.m. on Big Ten Network)<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> Not out of the question for the Badgers to finish 5-7, which would be fairly impressive considering they have one of the nation&#8217;s toughest schedules and one of the Big Ten&#8217;s worst rosters. <em>(Previous: 17)</em></p>
<h3>18. Purdue (2-9/0-8)</h3>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> lost at Washington 49-13<br />
<strong>Next up:</strong> idle<br />
<strong>Comment:</strong> If the conference had a mercy rule, the Boilermakers&#8217; season would have been called weeks ago. <em>(Previous: 18)</em></p>
