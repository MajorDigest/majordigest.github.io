    <p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Pistons/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Detroit Pistons</b></a> All-Star <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Cade_Cunningham/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Cade Cunningham</b></a> sat down for an in-depth interview with two-time Finals MVP <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Kevin_Durant/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Kevin Durant</b></a> on the Boardroom. </p><p>Cunningham opened up about personal challenges, including losing three people close to him shortly after moving away for prep school.</p><p>“I’ve never had nobody in my family, no nobody around me die,” Cunningham said. “That happens. Two more deaths. So, it’s three of them. And then 2 weeks after like all that, I find out my ex-girlfriend’s pregnant. I’m having my daughter, and I’m away from my parents. I’m away from everybody, bro.”</p><h3>Family matters</h3><p>Cunningham expressed deep gratitude for his parents, who have been a strong support system for him and his daughter.</p><p>“My parents, you know, I’m so thankful for them, bro. They’ve been such a like support system for me with my daughter and everything,” Cunningham said.</p><p>Cunningham shared how becoming a father in high school made him think his basketball career might be over. </p><p>“I’m thinking I’ve got to go back to the crib now and be a dad. Hoop is done for me,” Cunningham said.</p><p>“I thought it was done, bro,” Cunningham added. “Everybody I knew that had kids young like was done hooping, bro.”</p><p>Despite those doubts, Cunningham was still a five-star recruit, though he felt he wasn’t yet where he wanted to be in his basketball career.</p><p>His daughter was born when he was a junior in high school, a fact many didn’t know until he was drafted.</p><p>“You walk around here like a grown-up, and that’s why we respect you,” said Durant.</p><p>“That makes you grow up,” Cunningham said.</p><p>When it came time to pick a college, being closer to Dallas to support his daughter played a role in his decision.</p><p>“That played a part into it for sure,” Cunningham said.</p><p>Cunningham praised his family’s unwavering support during this time. </p><p>“My family, man, they are so supportive of me. Like, whenever all that stuff was going on, they like, ‘You’ve been begging to go now. Go for it.’”</p><p>Cunningham felt confident going into college knowing his family had his daughter covered. </p><p>“We got Riley, go for it. That’s fire,” Cunningham said.</p><p>This support gave Cunningham the freedom to choose any college without pressure, allowing him to focus on his basketball development.</p><p>Growing up in Dallas, Cunningham initially played football like his father but realized basketball was his true passion. </p><p>“I just wanted to hoop, bro,” Cunningham said. “My brother was already hooping, so it was just simple for me.”</p><p>Cunningham moved to Montverde Academy for prep school at age 16, living away from family for the first time. </p><p>“I was stuck,” Cunningham said about balancing fatherhood and basketball. “I thought I was done hooping, bro.”</p><h3>Oklahoma State/brother</h3><p>Cunningham credited his brother as a major influence in his basketball journey and college decision.</p><p>“My brother was at Oklahoma State. He’s telling me like, ‘Bro, those might be better schools for you,’” Cunningham said.</p><p>Though other top programs like Kentucky and North Carolina were options, Cunningham chose Oklahoma State to play for his brother, Cannen Cunningham, who had been a coach there the year before.</p><p>“You always wanted to play for your brother, though, huh?” Durant asked.</p><p>“That’s my man’s, bro,” Cade replied. </p><p>“He taught you how to play. He kind of groomed you. So it was a no-brainer to go to State,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade said they “just speak the same language,” and his brother is all about helping him be the best version of himself.</p><p>He also praised coach Mike Boynton, the head coach at the time, who was the first to offer him a scholarship. </p><p>Cade had built a strong relationship with him before his brother joined the staff.</p><p>“The whole team is from my area basically. Like I grew up playing. It just made sense,” Cade said.</p><p>He had a clear plan to enter the NBA after one college season and wanted to surround himself with the best people for that year.</p><p>Cade described Oklahoma State as a school where a player can leave a mark quickly. </p><p>He did just that, averaging around 20 points, five rebounds, and three assists per game as a freshman.</p><p>“I was nervous as hell my first game,” Cade admitted. “But by the second game, I was like, ‘Oh, yeah. This is going to be kind of a kickball.’”</p><p>He quickly adjusted to the physicality and competition, realizing he was still the best player on the court.</p><p>Cade also spoke highly of coach Boynton’s approach. </p><p>“He really coached you,” Cunningham said. “He’s like, ‘You got to allow me to coach you. You have to be coachable.’”</p><p>The coach never coddled him or made him feel above the team, which Cade respected deeply.</p><p>“I think that was why we overachieved that year,” Cade said.</p><h3>Big point guard</h3><p>Cunningham transitioned to playing point guard full-time during his youth basketball years, learning from watching great guards like Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Brandon Roy, and Jason Kidd.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Cunningham committed to Oklahoma State, where his brother was a coach. </p><p>“We just speak the same language, bro,” Cunningham said. “He understands me. He’s all about me being better.”</p><h3>“Don’t let me go to Cleveland” </h3><p>After his lone college season, Cade knew he was headed to the NBA but didn’t have a specific team in mind.</p><p>“Not at all, actually, bro,” Cunningham said when asked if he had a preferred team coming out of college.</p><p>As the draft lottery narrowed down to Detroit, Houston, and Cleveland, Cunningham had mixed feelings.</p><p>“I’m like, don’t let me go to Cleveland,” Cade said. “I don’t know if it was the red and blue. I don’t know if it was like Isiah Thomas.”</p><p>Cade was a big LeBron James fan growing up, but didn’t want to go to Cleveland.</p><p>Houston was closer to his hometown, Arlington, Texas, just four hours away, but Cade worried about the distractions.</p><p>“In my head, back of my head, I’m like, that might get tricky, you know?” Cade said.</p><p>Cade noted that many players prefer going to bigger markets like Houston rather than smaller college towns like Stillwater, Oklahoma.</p><p>Despite the options, Cunningham was happy to be drafted by Detroit.</p><p>“Obviously, I was so happy to go to Detroit, bro,” Cade said. “And everybody was kind of like, why are you, you know?”</p><p>He loves Detroit for its hardworking culture and the city’s gritty, self-made spirit.</p><p>Cade was selected first overall by the Pistons in the 2021 NBA draft. </p><h3>Grit</h3><p>Cade expressed his love for Detroit, praising the city’s hardworking, self-made spirit.</p><p>“I love Detroit for you for the simple fact that it’s a hardworking city,” Cade said. “The people there really grind. It’s a lot of self-made people there.”</p><p>He connected that grit to the Pistons’ legacy, especially the “Bad Boy” era and the 2004 championship team.</p><p>“I feel like you were the type of player to kind of bring that back together,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade acknowledged the team’s rough start, marked by losing streaks, coaching changes, and front-office shifts.</p><p>“It took some time through that year, like we started off slow,” Cade said. “I think we lost maybe like the first five games, first four games last year. Everybody was like, ‘Ah, here we go again.’”</p><p>The energy changed after a key road trip win against the Durant-led, then team, the Phoenix Suns, during a West Coast road trip.</p><p>“We came back, and it was energy in there, bro. And we never really turned back from there,” Cade said.</p><h3>Key veterans</h3><p>Veteran players like Tobias Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Malik Beasley brought experience and seriousness that elevated the team’s focus.</p><p>“They all made big plays for y’all, came and made big plays like they’re on the court but also in practice every day,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade described his leadership evolution, starting as a steady voice during losing times and growing into a more equipped leader alongside the vets.</p><p>“I feel like I’ve always just kind of been like a steady voice for real,” he said. “But I wasn’t ready yet to lead.”</p><p>Cunningham built camaraderie and chemistry with teammates, which helped the team rise together.</p><p>At 24, Cunningham leads a team with younger players coming up behind him, a challenging role he embraces.</p><p>His relationship with coach Bickerstaff has grown through their shared competitive spirit and love for the game.</p><p>“We both love the details of it, like what will make this work out better,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade respects Bickerstaff’s intensity and accountability, noting how the coach calls out players, including himself, to push the team.</p><p>“One thing I love about JB is how intense he is when he’s screaming at the ref. That’s how you can tell he loves, he wants to win so bad,” Cade said.</p><h3>Combo guard</h3><p>Cade shared insights on his offensive role and how he balances handling the ball with playing off it.</p><p>“I’ve had games where we’ve done that, you know what I mean? And it’s fun. It’s a good balance,” Cade said.</p><p>He explained that sometimes he needs to bring the ball up and facilitate, but other times it’s more efficient to come off screens and play off the ball, especially when defenders aggressively pick him up.</p><p>“It’s less energy to come down, come off the screen, maybe get the ball on the spot, and now we can play,” Cade said. “It’s a balance, bro. I’m still trying to figure it out for real.”</p><p>Cade credited Schroder for helping the team with ball movement and getting players in the right spots last season.</p><p>“He just knows how to get guys in spots,” Cade said. “He’s so savvy, bro. And he got that dog to him. He’ll pick up 94 feet. He doesn’t care who it is.”</p><p>When asked if he could share the backcourt with another true point guard, Cade said yes, especially with teammate Jaden Ivey.</p><p>“Me and Ivy, bro, we haven’t got a lot of time together,” Cade said. “But I think our approaches are like opposites attract, kind of. We have two different ways of going about it.”</p><p>Cade believes they could figure it out and be special together, though they haven’t had enough time on the court to fully develop chemistry.</p><p>“I think he’s somebody that he could pick up full court, he could be on the ball while I’m coming off the screens,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade noted Ivey’s improvement in shooting before his injury, calling him a “knockdown shooter” who can also attack the paint at will.</p><p>“So like now I’m coming off. He’s a knockdown shooter for me. We know he can get in the paint at will,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade also described himself as a versatile combo guard who can play positions one through four, bringing the ball up but also guarding bigger players and shooting catch-and-shoot shots.</p><h3>All-Star</h3><p>Cade celebrated making the NBA All-Star team for the first time last year.</p><p>“You made the All-Star team. Fire, bro,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade admitted he didn’t like the All-Star format.</p><p>“I felt for y’all, bro. Y’all first one, and y’all had to go through that type of like y’all still playing, bro. It was nasty,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade joked about not even getting to play against Durant during the event.</p><p>“But overall though, like being named the All-Star, that [expletive] is huge,” Cunningham said. “That’s something that nobody ever takes from you.”</p><p>Reflecting on the All-Star weekend, Cunningham described it as hectic with a packed schedule.</p><p>“My first one was sick, bro. I was done. I think they kind of took care of me. I feel like it was busy, though,” Cade said.</p><p>He enjoyed being part of the Rising Stars game, calling it amazing to be out there and part of the event.</p><p>“When you all you out there, it’s just like everybody there for you. Like everybody, there for us. Like the whole world watching us right now,” Cunningham said.</p><p>Cade described the experience as different and a great feeling.</p><h3>Playoff mindset</h3><p>Coming out of the All-Star break, Cade knew the team had to step up its game.</p><p>“Coming out this break, we’ve got to put our foot on the gas if we actually want to,” Cade said.</p><p>The Pistons made key trades, including acquiring Schroder, which added a new phase to the team’s development.</p><p>“It’s another phase of the team having to turn the page so quickly,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade described the challenge of preparing for different playoff opponents each night, contrasting it with the focused week-long preparation in the playoffs.</p><p>“It’s serious, bro,” Cade said. </p><p>Cade reflected on previous seasons where the team wasn’t competitive, making this playoff hunt a motivating experience.</p><p>“It’s a sick feeling, bro. To be in the hunt,” Cade said. “Everybody was just like, ‘Nah, we’re going to get in there for sure.’”</p><p>Cade acknowledged the team should have won their playoff series, discussing adjustments between games.</p><p>Cade admitted his first playoff game wasn’t what he wanted, shooting poorly and feeling passive.</p><p>“I got too passive,” Cade said. “They showing me bodies and I’m just getting off of it.”</p><p>Cade emphasized the importance of balancing aggression and decision-making, noting that mastering this balance could elevate his game to another level.</p><p>“It’s fun, bro. You know how fun this job is, especially in the playoffs,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade described the value of playing the same team repeatedly in the playoffs, learning from film, and improving.</p><p>He also discussed his daily routines, becoming more intentional with practice and shootarounds.</p><p>“I’m just more intent,” Cade said. “I go out there and work on it until it feels good.”</p><p>Cade shared that off the court, he keeps things chill, focusing on rest and recovery.</p><p>“I get my nap before the game, bro. I’m good to go,” Cade said.</p><p>Cade talked about shootaround routines, noting that the Pistons still shoot around most games, especially back-to-backs.</p><p>He explained how he fits individual workouts after shootaround, focusing on touch shots like jumpers, floaters, and left-hand hooks.</p><p>Cade revealed he’s working on developing his left-hand hook shot, a move that surprised many.</p><p>“I’m going to get it there,” Cade said. “You’ve got to get the bounce ones. Make your misses.”</p><h3>Detroit rap scene</h3><p>Cade is deeply involved in the Detroit music scene, balancing his NBA career with a passion for music.</p><p>“You heavy in the music, right? You like to make music. You got a studio at the house,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade confirmed his dedication to music, noting he’s been working hard in the studio.</p><p>“The Detroit rap scene is crazy. Sick, right? It’s almost like Atlanta’s level of taking over,” Durant said.</p><p>Durant mentioned seeing top Detroit artists like Babyface Ray, Peezy, Big Sean, and others at games.</p><p>“I’m tapped in with all them, bro. They all show love,” Cade said. “They put you on every song, Big Sean. Come out to the games, bro.”</p><p>Cade described Detroit as a community where artists and athletes support each other.</p><p>“It’s just a different love out there, bro. From everybody. I think everybody supports each other,” Cade said.</p><p>Being part of the Pistons has connected him to this vibrant community, which he loves.</p><p>“I just got dropped into a community like that. It’s fire, bro. I love it,” Cade said.</p><p>Durant also recommended checking out Bruiser Wolf, a rising Detroit artist.</p><h3>Nike deal</h3><p>Cade confirmed he has re-signed with Nike and will be getting his own signature shoe.</p><p>“I just got a text, matter of fact, saying that you signing back with Nike,” Durant said.</p><p>“That’s true. Yeah, it’s true,” Cade said.</p><p>“And you’re going to get your own signature shoe,” Durant replied.</p><p>The two reflected on the significance of the deal, with Cade expressing how meaningful it is.</p><p>“A signature athlete at Nike. I haven’t really grasped it yet,” Cade said. “That’s incredible.”</p><p>Cade talked about the logo design and the creative process ahead.</p><p>“You got the coldest. One of the coldest logos I’ve ever seen,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade shared how his perspective on shoes has evolved over his career.</p><p>“Early on, I was more like, ‘Just give me a shoe and I’ll put it on,’” Durant said. “But as I got older, I really started to value the whole process—from the ground up, advertising, all that.”</p><p>Durant emphasized how shoes become part of an athlete’s legacy, lasting beyond their playing days.</p><p>“Your kids, your daughter, going to be able to have her name on these shoes,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade called the opportunity a dream come true and expressed excitement for the creative journey.</p><p>Durant praised Cade as a “young legend” setting up the next generation.</p><p>“People are looking up to you right now, bro. So keep at it,” Durant said.</p><p>Cade acknowledged the support and reflected on how his impact might be appreciated more over time.</p>
