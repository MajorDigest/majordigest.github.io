<p><em>On to the roundup …</em></p>
<p><b>CCS Open Division </b></p>
<p><b>No. 1 Archbishop Riordan 33, No. 2 Serra 13</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riordan’s long climb to the top of the Central Coast Section ended triumphantly on Friday night at San Jose City College as the Crusaders handled Serra with much less drama than when the last met two weeks ago. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Christian Babcock was in San Jose and </span></i><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/21/riordan-football-serra-ccs-open-division-championship-michael-mitchell-jr/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">has the details here.</span></i></a></p>
<p><b>NCS Open Division</b></p>
<p><b>No. 1 De La Salle 24, No. 2 Pittsburg 17</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite a strong effort from Pittsburg, De La Salle captured its 33rd consecutive NCS title thanks to timely defensive stops. The Pirates controlled time of possession, had more first downs and converted on eight fourth downs, but De La Salle’s defense bent and didn’t break as the Spartans held the high-flying Pittsburg offense from piling up a lot of points. North Carolina commit <strong>Jaden Jefferson</strong> played nearly every snap and rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nathan Canilao was in Pleasant Hill and has the game story here.</span></i></p>


<p><strong>Grayson Doslak</strong> scored four touchdowns as Los Gatos&#8217; offense took charge in the second half, leading the Wildcats to a victory over previously undefeated Palma to advance to the Division I final next week against Open runner-up Serra. <em>David Kiefer was in Los Gatos and has the details here.</em></p>


<p>Acalanes held a 17-9 lead with just under three minutes to play in the first half. Cardinal Newman scored a touchdown 14 seconds before halftime and made a two-point conversion to even the score 17-17. That late first-half touchdown ignited a 43-0 run to end the game as Acalanes&#8217; perfect season ended. <em>Darren Sabedra has more details here.</em></p>


<p><strong>Caedon Afsharipour</strong> passed for five touchdowns to lead the Wildcats (6-6) into the championship game against Saturday’s Santa Teresa-Sacred Heart Cathedral winner. <strong>Zui Shelton</strong> caught two touchdown passes and<strong> Jack Farrell</strong> caught another and intercepted a pass. The Wildcat defense forced three turnovers, including two interceptions. <strong>Trevor van der Pyl</strong> scored for Menlo (9-3) on a late 8-yard TD pass from <strong>Jack Freehill</strong>. This marks the second consecutive CCS title game and third in four years for St. Ignatius, and the first under coach JaJuan Lawson. <em>&#8212; David Kiefer</em></p>
<p><b>NCS Division II</b></p>
<p><b>No. 2 Monte Vista 35, No. 3 California 21</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senior quarterback <strong>Ian Ondricek</strong> had two touchdowns, senior <strong>Torin Dunphy</strong> added two more and junior <strong>Justin Grisham</strong> rushed for another as Monte Vista defeated East Bay Athletic League Mountain Division rival California at home to advance to the Division II final against Clayton Valley. The Danville school built a 21-7 lead after the first quarter and didn’t relinquish the lead. California cut Monte Vista’s lead to seven to start the fourth quarter, but an interception helped the Mustangs rebuild their lead and close out the game strong. Monte Vista will be looking to capture its first NCS crown since 2016 next week. California ended its season 8-4. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>

<p><strong>Jhadis Luckey</strong> rushed for 127 yards and two touchdowns as Clayton Valley edged Campolindo on the road for the second time in a month, this time to reach the NCS Division II final.<em> Justice delos Santos was in Moraga and has the game story here. </em></p>
<p><b>CCS Division III</b></p>
<p><b>No. 3 Menlo-Atherton 35, No. 7 Sacred Heart Prep 14</b></p>
<p><b>Teddy Dacey </b><span style="font-weight: 400">threw three touchdown passes as Menlo-Atherton defeated Sacred Heart Prep for the second time this season. </span><b>Daniel Jackson</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>Lucca Keighery </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><b>Matthew Kwon</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> were on the receiving end of Dacey&#8217;s touchdown passes. </span><b>Eva Ama </b><span style="font-weight: 400">scored on a 25-yard run. </span><b>Matei Tau</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> capped the win with a 70-yard fumble return for a touchdown. </span><b>Jordan Lavulo</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> caused the fumble on a sack. </span><b>Andrew Shen</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Maxime Morelle </b><span style="font-weight: 400">scored on short runs for Sacred Heart Prep (6-6). Menlo-Atherton (6-6) advances to the D-III championship game, the first section title appearance for the program since capturing an Open Division crown in 2018, Saturday at MacDonald High against San Mateo, a team the Bears defeated 42-28 on Sept. 26. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212; Glenn Reeves</span></i></p>
<p><b>No. 8 San Mateo 40, No. 4 Live Oak 36</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">San Mateo (9-3) rushed for 436 yards in its second road playoff win in as many weeks. The Bearcats will have an opportunity to win their first CCS championship since 2003 when they play Menlo-Atherton on Saturday at MacDonald High in a 7 p.m. start. Against Live Oak,</span><b> Lukas Fitzgerald</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> carried 20 times for 112 yards and one touchdown.

Sophomore </span><b>TJ Johnson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> had three carries for 103 yards and a 62-yard touchdown. </span><b>Cameron Barry</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, a slotback along with Copus and Johnson in San Mateo&#8217;s triple option offense, had a 70-yard scoring run. Fullback </span><b>Yianni Fitzgerald</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> also scored on the ground. Live Oak&#8217;s </span><b>Josiah Delgado</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> rushed for 175 yards on 26 carries and two touchdowns.</span><b> Adrian Leal</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> threw touchdown passes to </span><b>Anthony Rocha</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Praise God Ofobuike </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and ran for another. The Acorns finished 9-3.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8212; Glenn Reeves</span></i></p>
<p><b>NCS Division III </b></p>
<p><b>No. 3 El Cerrito 26, No. 2 Rancho Cotate 9</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">El Cerrito continued what has been a very strong bounce-back season by traveling to Rohnert Park and handling Rancho Cotate. One year after forfeiting numerous games for playing ineligible players, the Gauchos (10-2) will play for the D-III championship. El Cerrito scored two rushing TDs and returned a blocked punt for a touchdown. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Christian Babcock</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">   </span></p>
<p><b>CCS Division IV</b></p>
<p><b>No. 1 Branham 56, No. 5 Half Moon Bay 45</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Michael Murphy</strong> scored three touchdowns – on runs of 34, 39, and 76 yards – to lead the top-seeded Bruins (7-5) at home. Branham advances to a Blossom Valley Athletic League Mount Hamilton Division rematch for the CCS Division IV title next Saturday at 7 p.m. at San Jose City College. <strong>Andrew Ho</strong> passed for four touchdowns and had more than 250 yards in total offense for a Branham team that advances to a CCS title game for the third time in program history while searching for its first championship. Half Moon Bay (8-4) took a 15-0 lead on a 47-yard touchdown pass from <strong>Paxton Holden</strong> to <strong>Levi Meighen</strong> and on a 1-yard run by <strong>Joedoln Flores</strong>.<em> &#8212; David Kiefer</em></span></p>

<p>Lincoln outscored Willow Glen 35-0 in the second half to advance to a CCS final for the first time in program history. <strong>Kyan Phillips</strong> carried 20 times for 220 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Lions. <em>Glenn Reeves has the complete recap here.</em></p>
<p><b>NCS Division IV</b></p>
<p><b>No. 1 Hayward 41, No. 4 Granada 18</b></p>
<p><b>Maurice Hall </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><b>Lamont McDonald </b><span style="font-weight: 400">ran wild as Hayward routed Granada at home to reach the D-IV title game. Hall had 12 carries for 109 yards and two TDs, while McDonald had 11 for 190 and a score for the Farmers (9-3). McDonald added three catches for 39 yards and a pair of scores through the air, plus an interception on defense. </span><b>Isiah Spearman </b><span style="font-weight: 400">caught four balls for 46 yards, and </span><b>Tywan Melrose </b><span style="font-weight: 400">caught a 2-yard TD. QB </span><b>Jaydyn Irving </b><span style="font-weight: 400">went 11 of 15 for 110 yards and three scores. Hayward held Granada (6-6) to 215 total yards. </span><b>Jack Badger </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><b>Damien Miles </b><span style="font-weight: 400">had TD receptions for the Matadors, and </span><b>Skyler Stuart </b><span style="font-weight: 400">ran in a score. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Christian Babcock</span></i></p>
<p><b>No. 3 Miramonte 20, No. 7 Redwood 0</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miramonte will have a chance to win its 11th section championship next week after its defense picked a great time for its first shutout of the season. </span><b>Tres Buster</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> had nine tackles at middle linebacker, </span><b>Andrew Bjornson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> recorded a sack and </span><b>Henry Hunt’s</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> interception sealed the victory as the trio helped shut down an opponent that scored 27 points last week against Benicia. “We pulled out a gritty win,” Miramonte coach Nick Safir said. “Big win for our program.” Junior varsity call-up </span><b>Lane Dalton</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, making his third start in place of injured quarterback </span><b>Carson Blair</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, passed for 204 yards and ran for a short touchdown. He set up the score with a 60-yard completion to </span><b>Luca Tarantino</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><b>David Roman</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> scored on a 7-yard run and</span><b> James Rogers </b><span style="font-weight: 400">kicked field goals from 35 and 41 yards out to account for the scoring. Miramonte (7-5) advances to the final against top-seeded Hayward as the Matadors will try to avenge last season’s loss to Arcata in the NCS Division VI final.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – Darren Sabedra</span></i></p>
<p><b>NCS Division VI</b></p>
<p><b>No. 3 Bishop O’Dowd 49, No. 2 St. Helena 26</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dragons got scoring from several players, including some on defense, to run away for a semifinal victory. </span><b>OC Lehner </b><span style="font-weight: 400">snagged a pick-six and also forced a fumble. </span><b>Lamar Ellis</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> ran in four TDs.</span><b> Christian Cermenelli Johnson </b><span style="font-weight: 400">passed and rushed for one TD apiece. </span><b>Jess Brown </b><span style="font-weight: 400">caught the TD pass. </span><b>Victor Martinez </b><span style="font-weight: 400">grabbed an interception.

<p><b>NCS Division VII</b></p>
<p><b>No. 2 Piedmont 28, No. 3 Willits 10</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Less than five years after its football program was nearly cut, Piedmont has a chance to win an NCS championship. “We’re making history!!” coach Jordan Seiden wrote in a text. “From a program that was almost dropped 4 years ago to where we are now!! No one would’ve thunk it!!!” </span><b>Xavier Henderson</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> ran for four touchdowns on Friday night and the defense made numerous big stops as Piedmont (8-4), playing at home, turned back Willits to advance to play top seed Middletown next week for the championship.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – Darren Sabedra</span></i></p>

<p>The top-seeded Mustangs (10-2) advanced to Friday’s title game at Justin-Siena against No. 2 Piedmont. Concord (7-5), playing on the road, concluded its season at 7-5. <em>&#8212; David Kiefer</em></p>
