    <p>The No. 18-ranked <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wolverines/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Michigan Wolverines </b></a>continued their dominance over the Maryland Terrapins, winning 45-20 while improving to 12-1 in the matchup.</p><p>Saturday’s game started off with fireworks as Michigan improved to 9-2 on the season. </p><p>Michigan’s defense gave up an opening-drive touchdown, but they settled in early and took a 21-10 lead behind the hot start by Bryce Underwood, leading the offense to three touchdowns in the game’s first three drives.</p><p>Underwood finished the day 16-23 for 215 and two touchdowns, while accumulating 20 yards on eight carries, but tailback Bryson Kuzdzal showed that he could carry the load as he toted the rock 20 times for 100 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p>Jasper Parker found the endzone in the fourth quarter as he carried the ball eight times for 23 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>Underwood connected with Andrew Marsh five times for 76 yards and a touchdown.</p><p>Donaven McCulley caught two passes for 46 yards and a touchdown and Marlin Klein hauled in three catches and 37 yards in the game.</p><p>Fellow tight end Zack Marshall and receiver Channing Goodwin each had two receptions in the matchup.</p><p>The Wolverines opened the second half with three more touchdowns on their first three drives to blow the game open.</p><p>Next up for Michigan is the Ohio State Buckeyes in “The Game” inside the Big House with their College Football Playoff hopes on the line.</p><p>With a victory, Michigan would have a shot at the CFP, but it would also potentially knock out the Buckeyes from the Big Ten Championship game as well.</p><h3>History</h3><p>This was the 13th meeting between Michigan and Maryland, and the Wolverines had won 12 of the 13 previous meetings, including Saturday’s matchup.</p><p>Michigan has won nine straight in the series and owns a 9–1 record against Maryland since both joined the Big Ten East. </p><p>The Terrapins earned the lone Big Ten-opening victory when they beat Michigan 23–16 at Michigan Stadium in 2014.</p><p>Michigan answered the next year with its first-ever trip to College Park, shutting out Maryland 28–0 in 2015. </p><p>The teams first met in non‑conference play at the Big House, where Michigan swept the early series with wins of 20–0 (1985), 41–21 (1989), and 45–17 (1990). </p><p>Michigan also fielded strong local representation, with 12 players on the roster from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia.</p><h3>1st quarter</h3><p>Michigan won the coin toss and deferred until the second half, sending their defense on the field first.</p><p>After the kickoff, Maryland running back Dejuan Williams, on the first play of the game, ran up the sideline for a 20-yard gain.</p><p>After an incompletion on the new set of downs, Williams gained two yards on second down.</p><p>Quarterback Malik Washington completed a deep pass down the left sideline to the Michigan 24-yard line to Shaleak Knotts for 29 yards.</p><p>Williams gained three yards on first down, setting up a flea flicker, which was kept by Washington, who gained 13 yards down to the nine-yard line.</p><p>Williams ran for one yard before Washington kept the ball for no gain on first down before completing a pass to Octavian Smith Jr.</p><p>On third and one, Williams got stuffed before Washington completed a fourth-and-goal pass to Dorian Fleming, who capped off a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown reception, eating up 4:32 off the game clock before kicker Sean O’Haire knocked in the extra point.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wink_Martindale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wink_Martindale/"><b>Wink Martindale</b></a>’s defense came out unprepared and uninformed on that opening drive as Michigan trailed 7-0.</p><p>With nothing to lose, Maryland did an onside kick, but it was recovered by Michigan, setting up the offense at the 47-yard line of the Terrapins.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryce_Underwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryce_Underwood/"><b>Bryce Underwood</b></a> took the snap and threw incomplete to <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Deakon_Tonielli/"

<a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryson_Kuzdzal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryson_Kuzdzal/"><b>Bryson Kuzdzal</b></a> for eight yards.</p><p>On third and two, Kuzdzal toted the rock to the Terrapins’ 32-yard line for a gain of seven yards.</p><p>Kuzdzal gained 14 yards on an explosive run up the sideline before getting stuffed for a one-yard gain.</p><p>On second and nine from the Maryland 13-yard line, Underwood handed the ball off to Kuzdzal, who gained one yard again.</p><p>With third and eight from the Maryland 12-yard line, head coach <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Sherrone_Moore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Sherrone_Moore/"><b>Sherrone Moore</b></a> called his first timeout of the game.</p><p>On third down and eight, Underwood connected with <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Andrew_Marsh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"

with the extra point, as Michigan answered the opening drive touchdown of the Terrapins.</p><p>After the touchback, Washington completed a pass of 15 yards to Jalil Farooq before finding Knotts for eight yards.</p><p>Washington hit Nolan Ray for a gain of three yards before throwing incomplete on back-to-back passes, setting up a third and 10.</p><p>Michigan got called for offsides before Washington handed the ball off to Williams for a loss of one, setting up a punt.</p><p>The 38-yard punt was fielded by Marsh and returned for nine yards to their 17-yard line.</p><p>With the ball on their second possession of the game, Underwood overthrew his receiver, which nearly got intercepted, but the defender couldn’t hold on.</p><p>Michigan got away with one there.</p><p>On second-and-10, Michigan was called for a false start, moving them back five yards.</p><p>Facing second and 15 from their own 12-yard line, Underwood completed a pass to Marsh for an 11-yard gain.</p><p>On third and four, Underwood found fullback <a href="http://clickondetroit.com/topic/Max_Bredeson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="http://clickondetroit.com/topic/Max_Bredeson/"><b>Max Bredeson</b></a> for a seven-yard catch and run to move the sticks.</p><p>Kuzdzal gained six yards on his first carry of the drive, moving the ball to the 36-yard line.</p><p>He gained five yards to gain another first down on the drive.</p><p>Underwood found Marsh, who was wide open for a 25-yard catch and run to continue to move the sticks with 1:52 to play.</p><p>A Maryland defender was injured during the play as he tried to make the tackle to get Marsh down. A timeout was called.</p><p>Kuzdzal carried the ball for a one-yard gain to the 33-yard line of the Terrapins.</p><p>Underwood found a crossing <a

title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jasper_Parker/"><b>Jasper Parker</b></a> gained two yards on a run.</p><h3>2nd quarter</h3><p>Kuzdzal gained the first down, setting up a first and two run and score to take a 14-7 lead following a Zvada extra point.</p><p>The drive was 12 plays for 83 yards.</p><p>Iverson Harper gained two yards on his first carry of the game before Washington threw a long ball down the field, but it was broken up by <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Zeke_Berry/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Zeke Berry</b></a>.</p><p>Washington threw an interception to <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Mason_Curtis/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Mason Curtis</b></a>.</p><p>Michigan got called for an infraction, moving the ball back five yards.</p><p>On first and 15, Underwood connected with Marshall for 10 yards, setting up a second and five.</p><p>Kuzdzal got blasted in the backfield for a four-yard loss.</p><p>On third and nine, from Maryland’s 22-yard line, Underwood threw a wide receiver screen pass to wide receiver <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Donaven_McCulley/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Donaven McCulley</b></a>, who broke multiple defenders on the play for a 22-yard catch and run, taking a 21-7 lead following the Zvada made extra point.</p><p>Offensive coordinator <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Chip_Lindsey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Chip_Lindsey/"><b>Chip Lindsey</b></a> was in his coaching bag early as the Wolverines’ passing attack was fluid as they capped off a three-play 23-yard drive in 1:09 to take a 14-point lead.</p><p>Washington opened the following drive with a pass to Smith Jr.,

and 11, Maryland sent out O’Haire for a 34-yard field goal attempt, which was good.</p><p>The drive took 12 plays and 59 yards, chewing up 5:25, and cut the deficit to 21-10 with 7:03 to play.</p><p>Marsh returned the following kickoff to the 20-yard line of Maryland, following the 54-yard kickoff for a gain of nine yards.</p><p>Kuzdzal rushed the ball for a gain of eight yards and

seven yards (took two sacks) and Parker had one yard in the game’s first 30 minutes.</p><p>Martindale’s defense held the Terrapins to 41 yards rushing, but his backend was giving up big plays as

target="_blank" rel=""><b>Brandyn Hillman</b></a> laid down the boom on the receiver as the ball fell out of bounds.</p><p>The quarterback kept the ball for a 23-yard gain before throwing back-to-back incompletions, setting up a third and 10 from Michigan’s 25.</p><p>Feeling the rush, Washington found Smith Jr. for a diving 16-yard catch to keep the drive alive.</p><p>Williams carried the ball for a four-yard gain, setting up a second and six with under 8:30 to play.</p><p>Washington threw an incomplete pass in the end zone to Smith Jr., and on third and six, got sacked by <a

seven.</p><p>That was the second sack on third down in the red zone by Michigan as O’Haire kicked in another field goal, capping off a 12-play 64-yard drive that ate up 4:01 in the quarter.</p><p>That

line, Underwood drew Maryland offsides to gain a free five yards and an automatic first down.</p><p>On first down and nine, Underwood scrambled for seven yards before Kuzdzal got tackled for one yard.</p><p>The replay showed that Kuzdzal reached the ball over the goal line for a touchdown, and the play went under the hood for further review.</p><p>After further review, the call was overturned, giving Kuzdzal his second touchdown of the game, as Michigan took a 35-13 lead with 3:57 remaining in the game.</p><p>Zvada kicked the ball on top of the building, under the scoreboard,
