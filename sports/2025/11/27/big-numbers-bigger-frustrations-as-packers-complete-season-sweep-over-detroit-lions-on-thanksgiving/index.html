missing Watson across the middle of the field on second down.</p><p>On third down and 10, Love, who was 3-5 for 31 yards, threw an incomplete pass, setting up a Brandon McManus field goal attempt from 45 yards out, which was up and good to take a 3-0 lead.</p><p>The Lions offense took the field for the first time, and quarterback <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jared_Goff/"

possession.</p><p>Head coach <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Dan_Campbell/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Dan Campbell</b></a> became the Lions’ play caller against the Washington

receiver handoff to Bo Melton for a one-yard gain before throwing incomplete on second down.</p><p>Facing a third and nine, Love found running back Chris Brooks for a four-yard gain that was leveled
