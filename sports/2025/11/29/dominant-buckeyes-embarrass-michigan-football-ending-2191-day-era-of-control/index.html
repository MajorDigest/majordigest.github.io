    <p>The No. 15-ranked <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wolverines/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Michigan Wolverines’</b></a> 2,191-day streak since Ohio State last defeated them ended in embarrassing fashion, as the Buckeyes showed why they were the No. 1-ranked team in the nation, winning 27-9.</p><p>The atmosphere was electric to start The Game on Saturday (Nov. 29), but after a 9-3 lead at the end of the first quarter, Ohio State flipped a switch and dismantled Michigan, as Michigan could not move the ball on offense.</p><p>Both teams battled for seeding in the College Football Playoff, well, at least Michigan did, as Ohio State was already locked in with a top seed as they were 11-0 heading into the matchup.</p><p>Michigan needed the victory to keep its hopes alive, as a loss all but certainly ended its title hopes, as no three-loss team was getting selected as one of the top 12 teams to cut.</p><p>In the biggest game of the season, the Wolverines had 16 yards passing to end the first half, as Ohio State led 17-9.</p><p>Freshman quarterback <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryce_Underwood/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Bryce Underwood</b></a> completed three passes on six attempts for 16 yards in 30 minutes of game action.</p><p>Michigan moved the ball into Ohio State’s territory three times but came away with three field goals as the leg of <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Dominic_Zvada/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Dominic Zvada</b></a> was the MVP of the first half.</p><p>The rushing attack in the first half was fine as <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jordan_Marshall/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Jordan Marshall</b></a> carried the ball four times for 68 yards, while <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryson_Kuzdzal/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Bryson Kuzdzal</b></a> led the team in carries with 10 for 38 yards.</p><p>Michigan couldn’t even get Underwood going on the ground in the first half, as he ran the ball five times for nine yards.</p><p>Underwood finished the day completing 8-18 for 63 yards and an interception as Ohio State’s defense, led by former <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Detroit_Lions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Detroit_Lions/"><b>Detroit Lions</b></a> head coach Matt Patricia, made it look like they were playing with 12 men on the field.</p><p>Patricia had his guys ready to play, and it showed as they outphysicalled the Wolverines. </p><h3>History</h3><p>Saturday was the 121st time that Michigan and Ohio State squared off, with the men in maize holding a 62-53-6 advantage all-time.</p><p>Michigan held a four-game winning streak over the Buckeyes, dating back to the 2021 season, before Saturday’s loss in Ann Arbor.</p><p>The winning streak of four consecutive games hasn’t been done since 1988-1991, and another victory would have tied Michigan with the 1922-1927 teams, who’ve beaten the Buckeyes five times in a row, but the streak ended.</p><p>The Buckeyes have an all-time losing record inside the Big House, as the Wolverines are 33-25-4 in Ann Arbor.</p><p>The Wolverines are 25-23-3 inside Michigan Stadium against the Buckeyes.</p><p>Michigan has won in 40 of its last 47 games against conference schools.</p><p><a href="https://ESPN.com" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://ESPN.com"><i>ESPN.com</i></a> <i> selected The Game as the greatest rivalry in all of sports in 1999.</i></p><p>The Game ranks tied for the 14th most-played rivalry in FBS (Division I-A) history.</p><p>There have been 24 occasions when the two schools decided the Big Ten champion between themselves based on the outcome that Saturday; for 10 years (1972-81), the outcome determined which of the two teams would represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl.</p><p>Since 1922, more people have attended this game than any other gridiron match-up in the country.</p><h3>1st quarter</h3><p>Ohio State won the coin toss and deferred until the second half, sending freshman quarterback <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryce_Underwood/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Bryce Underwood</b></a> and the Wolverines’ offense on the field first.</p><p>The kickoff went for a touchback, and with the first snap of the game, running back <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jordan_Marshall/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Jordan Marshall</b></a><b> </b>gained 36 yards.</p><p>Underwood completed a 10-yard pass to Marshall to move the ball into the Buckeyes’ territory.</p><p>Marshall gained two yards on first down, setting up a second and eight.</p><p>On second down, Underwood took the snap and gained no yards.</p><p>Facing a third down and eight, Ohio State called its first timeout of the game with 12:45 to play as the fans chanted “Let’s go blue.”</p><p>With the ball on the 27-yard line of Ohio State, Underwood threw an incomplete pass, sending kicker <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Dominic_Zvada/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Dominic Zvada</b></a> to attempt a 45-yard field goal, which went straight into the net, giving Michigan a 3-0 lead.</p><p>The Wolverines went six plays for 48 yards and chewed up 2:23 off the game clock.</p><p>After the field goal, Michigan kicked the ball to Ohio State, and it was fair caught by Brandon Inniss.</p><p>On first down and 10 from the 25-yard line, quarterback Julian Sayin went long to wide receiver Carnell Tate, but he was broken up by cornerback <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Zeke_Berry/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Zeke Berry</b></a>.</p><p>Sayin threw an interception towards wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, but it was intercepted by <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jyaire_Hill/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Jyaire Hill</b></a>.</p><p>With the ball on the 39-yard line, Underwood scrambled for seven yards.</p><p>On second and three, Underwood lined up under center for the first time of the season and handed the ball to Marshall, who gained 21 yards on the play.</p><p>With the ball on the 11-yard line, Underwood kept the ball and scrambled for two yards.</p><p>Facing a second and eight, Marshall gained two yards.</p><p>With third and six, Underwood threw incomplete to wide receiver <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Donaven_McCulley/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Donaven McCulley</b></a>, setting up another field goal attempt, this time from 25 yards out, which was successful.</p><p>The scoring drive was six plays and 32 yards in 2:40.</p><p>After the fair catch by Inniss, Sayin, following their first possession of two passes and an interception, handed the ball off to Bo Jackson, who gained five yards and was stopped by cornerback <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Brandyn_Hillman/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Brandyn Hillman,</b></a> who made a touchdown-saving tackle.</p><p>On second down and five, Jackson gained three yards on the play to the 33-yard line.</p><p>Facing a third and two, Sayin went play action and found Will Kacmarek for five yards.</p><p>Saying connected with Jackson for a 22-yard catch and run.</p><p>With a new set of downs, Sayin, Jackson, following some poor tackling, got outside and picked up 37 yards before getting forced out of bounds.</p><p>On first down and three, Sayin threw to Smith on a fade route, but the ball fell incomplete.</p><p>Jackson took the ball and gained no yards, but <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Jaishawn_Barham/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Jaishawn Barham</b></a> got called for unsportsmanlike conduct, gifting Ohio State a fresh set of downs.</p><p>CJ Donaldson Jr ran the ball twice, once for a yard and another for no gain, but <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Mason_Curtis/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Mason Curtis</b></a> got injured on the play and was seen in discomfort as he was bent backwards.</p><p>The run was replayed, and officials upheld the call.</p><p>Facing another third and one from the one-yard line, Michigan’s defense, playing bend but don’t break defense, stopped Sayin on a quarterback sneak.</p><p>The call was a touchdown, but after further review, Sayin was a yard short, with his knee down short of the goal line.</p><p>Facing a pivotal fourth down, with the fans erupting, Ohio State got called for a false start, moving the ball back five yards.</p><p>Kicker Jayden Fielding drilled the kick, which looked like a miss from the press box, but Ohio State finished its 11-play 69-yard drive with three points while chewing 4:33 off the game clock.</p><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Bryson_Kuzdzal/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Bryson Kuzdzal</b></a> got his first carry of the game and picked up five yards before Michigan got called for holding on second down.</p><p>Ohio State declined the play, so on third down and five, Underwood carried the ball for no gain, setting up their first punt of the game.</p><p>Inniss returned the punt 15 yards to the Ohio State 37-yard line. The punt went 48 yards by <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Hudson_Hollenbeck/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Hudson Hollenbeck</b></a>.</p><p>On first down, Sayin hit Smith for a one-yard gain.</p><p>Facing second down and nine, Sayin handed the ball off to Jackson for a two-yard gain, stopped by defensive back <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/TJ_Metcalf/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>TJ Metcalf</b></a>.</p><p>On third and seven, Sayin hit Tate for an eight-yard gain.</p><p>Jackson carried the ball for three yards to the 49-yard line of Michigan to end the first quarter.</p><h3>2nd quarter</h3><p>Sayin handed the ball off to Jackson, who got stopped for one yard.</p><p>Tate picked up six yards on the next play from Sayin to pick up the first down.</p><p>With the ball of the 40, Sayin eluded the Michigan defenders and found Max Klare for a five-yard gain.</p><p>Jackson took the handoff on second down and gained no yards on the play.</p><p>With another chance to get off the field, Michigan’s defense stopped Jackson for no gain, forcing a fourth and five.</p><p>Ohio State’s offense lined up to go for it, and Sayin made a great throw to Tate, who shook Berry for a 35-yard touchdown to take a 10-6 lead with 11:44 to play.</p><p>Amazing out and up by Tate and an even more impressive pass by Sayin as Ohio State took their first lead of the game as the snowflakes started coming down.</p><p>The scoring drive by Ohio State was 10 plays for 63 yards in 5:49 seconds.</p><p>Michigan’s offense needs to play catch-up and answer with a touchdown of its own, as it kicked field goals on two of its first three possessions of the game.</p><p>Wide receiver <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Andrew_Marsh/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Andrew Marsh</b></a><b> </b>took the kickoff and got blasted at the 16-yard line.</p><p>Kuzdzal gained two yards on the first play of the possession, followed by another four-yard carry, before Underwood threw a deep bomb to Marsh, who got shoved to the ground, drawing a pass interference on the play.</p><p>The referee got flustered and pumped fake, throwing a flag because he grabbed it before he could get it out and toss it.</p><p>Kuzdzal gained five yards on the play until he nearly broke one, but was tackled after gaining 22 yards on the play.</p><p>He picked up two yards on the next run, setting up second and eight from the 34 of Ohio State.</p><p>Kuzdzal gained two yards on second down to the 32-yard line.</p><p>On third down and six, Underwood hit McCulley for six yards to the 26-yard line for a first down.</p><p>Kuzdzal picked up one yard on first down, moving the ball to the 25-yard line.</p><p>On second and nine, Kuzdzal lost five yards as he was tackled in the backfield.</p><p>Facing a third and 14, Underwood threw a checkdown to Kuzdzal for no gain.</p><p>With the ball on the 30-yard line, Zvada attempted a 40-yard field goal, which was good, capping off an 11-play 54-yard drive in 6:17, cutting the lead to 10-9 with 5:24 to play.</p><p>Michigan had the ball in Ohio State territory three times and came away with three field goals in the first half.</p><p>Michigan is leaning heavily on the running game, as Underwood had 16 yards passing at this point in The Game.</p><p>A penalty was called on the following kickoff on Ohio State, moving them back to the 13-yard line.</p><p>With their backs against the wall, Ohio State went play action, and Sayin found Tate for a nine-yard catch and run.</p><p>Sayin started heating up as he hit Kacmarek for 25 yards.</p><p>Jackson picked up 16 yards on the next play, moving the ball into Michigan territory.</p><p>Sayin threw incomplete to Klare with 3:24 to play in the first half.</p><p>On second and 10, Sayin hit Jackson for five yards, setting up third and five from the 32-yard line.</p><p>Needing a stop, Michigan’s defense got cooked as Inniss was wide open for an eight-yard gain.</p><p>On first and 10 with the clock nearing the two-minute timeout, head coach <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Sherrone_Moore/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Sherrone Moore</b></a><b> </b>called a timeout for some odd reason, stopping the clock at 2:03.</p><p>Returning to action, Ohio State ran a unique play where Sayin tossed the ball as he was running left to Jackson, who was running right for a nine-yard gain.</p><p>Out of the timeout, Ohio State looked to keep its foot on the gas as Jackson carried the ball for four yards to pick up the first down.</p><p>With the ball on the 11-yard line of Michigan, Jackson carried the ball for eight yards down to the three-yard line.</p><p>Jackson carried the ball for a loss of one, moving the ball back to the three.</p><p>Ohio State called their second timeout of the first half, leaving them with one with 20 seconds remaining before halftime.</p><p>Sayin was 12-16 for 141 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception heading into that pivotal third-and-three play out of the timeout.</p><p>Back to game action, with their backs against the wall, Michigan’s defense gave up another touchdown, this time to a wide-open Inniss to take a 17-9 lead.</p><p>Sayin was cooking as he finished the half, leading an 11-play 87-yard drive, eating up 5:07 while scoring his second touchdown of the half.</p><p>Underwood handed the ball off once again to Kuzdzal for no gain to end the half.</p><p>What is going on with Michigan’s offense as Underwood, their high-priced quarterback, completed 3-5 passes for 16 passing yards in the biggest game of the season. </p><p>Marsh has one target for zero yards, and Underwood’s most extended play of the half was for 10 yards to Marshall in the first quarter.</p><h3>3rd quarter</h3><p><a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Wink_Martindale/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Wink Martindale</b></a> called a good game in the first half, but offensive coordinator <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Chip_Lindsey/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Chip Lindsey</b></a><b> </b>needed to get the passing game going.</p><p>Sayin opened the second half with a completion to Smith for four yards, setting up a second and six.</p><p>On second down, Jackson gained five yards on the play, moving the ball to the 30-yard line.</p><p>Facing their first third down of the half, Jackson picked up three yards to move the sticks.</p><p>With a fresh set of downs, Sayin handed the ball off to Jackson for a two-yard gain to the 35-yard line.</p><p>Jackson picked up 12 yards on a catch and run as Sayin found him wide open to continue the drive.</p><p>Sayin threw an incomplete pass to Klare, who was wide open but couldn’t hold on to the ball to complete the catch.</p><p>Jackson gained two yards on second down with the ball on the 49-yard line.</p><p>Needing a big stop, Michigan’s defense gang tackled Klare, holding him to six yards, forcing Ohio State’s first punt of the game.</p><p>Underwood hit McCulley, who made a catch of 26 yards over triple coverage.</p><p>He threw to tight end <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Marlin_Klein/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Marlin Klein</b></a><b> </b>for no gain, followed by Kuzdzal, who gained no yards, setting up a third and 10.</p><p>Underwood threw to Kuzdzal, who dropped the ball, forcing another punt and ending the good drive, followed by a Hollenbeck shanked punt that went for 11 yards.</p><p>After the shanked punt, Ohio State got the ball on their 43-yard line, leading 17-9 with the snow flurries coming down as Sayin hit Tate for a seven-yard gain to midfield.</p><p>On second down, Sayin hit Tate, who was running wide open down the middle of the field for a 50-yard catch and run to blow The Game wide open as Ohio State took a 24-9 lead with 7:35 to play in the quarter.</p><p>Saying was on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy as he completed 18-23 passes for 224 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception.</p><p>Michigan’s defense continued to leave guys open, and its offense was a joke.</p><p>Marshall took his first handoff since the first quarter for no gain, followed by Underwood going uptempo and finding McCulley for 14 yards to move the sticks.</p><p>Caleb Downs nearly picked off Underwood, who was looking for Klein, but got hit early before the ball arrived.</p><p>Marshall gained two yards on second down, setting up a third and eight where Underwood threw to McCulley, who drew a pass interference call to keep the drive alive.</p><p>Underwood threw to Marshall, who dropped the ball on first and 10.</p><p>On second and 10, Marshall got tackled for a loss of two yards.</p><p>McCulley made a great catch, but Underwood led him way out of bounds as the press box and the fans in the cold, snow-filled stands were silent as they could feel the game slipping away.</p><h3>4th quarter</h3><p>Facing a second and 11, Sayin hit Klare for a nine-yard gain, setting up a third and two, but Jackson gained 13 yards on the play as the defense continued to look lost on the field.</p><p>Isaiah West toted the rock for a one-yard loss on first down, before gaining 14 yards to continue the drive.</p><p>More poor tackling ensued as Jackson picked up nine yards to the dismay of the fans.</p><p>Jackson gained no yards on the play, setting up a third down and one from the 13-yard line.</p><p>Sayin kept the ball and picked up two yards on the quarterback sneak as the rushing attack continued to outmatch the Wolverines.</p><p>Donaldson carried the ball for five yards on the play, moving the ball to the six-yard line.</p><p>He picked up one yard on the play, setting up another third down. </p><p>This time, the ball went out the back of the end zone as Fielding capped an 80-yard, 20-play drive that ate up 11:56, pushing the lead to 27-9 with 8:10 to play.</p><p>After the punt, Sayin took the ball from the 14-yard line and gained eight yards on the play, moving the ball to their own 22-yard line.</p><p>Isaiah West picked up two yards to get the first down, followed by Jackson, who picked up two yards on first down.</p><p>Jackson
