    <p>The high school football season has reached its penultimate weekend.</p>
<p>More hardware will be at stake as teams try to add NorCal championship trophies to the section titles they won in their most recent games.</p>
<p>From heavyweights Archbishop Riordan, Pittsburg and Serra to newcomers Lincoln-San Jose and Piedmont Hills, they all have their sights on making it to the final destination:</p>
<p>Next week’s state championships in Southern California.</p>
<p>To get there, they’ll have to win regional titles Friday or Saturday, some in the comfort of their home field and others several hours away.</p>
<p>Central Coast Section Open Division champion Riordan, the highest-rated team from the Bay Area News Group’s coverage area playing this weekend, will travel to the Sierra foothills on Friday to face Sac-Joaquin Section powerhouse Folsom.</p>
<p>North Coast Section Division I champion Pittsburg will be at home on Saturday to face high-powered Central East of Fresno, which won the Central Section Division I championship over Clovis 70-35 on Nov. 21.</p>
<p>The Bengals needed only three quarters to reach 70 points against an opponent that beat CCS Division I runner-up Los Gatos this season.</p>
<p>At least two teams that this news organization covers will join De La Salle in SoCal next weekend.</p>
<p>Monte Vista will visit St. Ignatius on Friday for the Division 3-AA NorCal title. On Saturday, Menlo-Atherton will play host to El Cerrito for the 3-A NorCal crown.</p>
<p>De La Salle was selected by the California Interscholastic Federation to represent the North in the Open Division state title game against Santa Margarita on Dec. 13 in Mission Viejo. So the Spartans have this weekend off.</p>
<p>On to the NorCal matchups:</p>
<p><b>DIVISION 1-AA: ARCHBISHOP RIORDAN VS. FOLSOM</b></p>
<p><b>Records: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Riordan 12-0, Folsom 12-1</span></p>
<p><b>Kickoff: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Friday at Folsom, 7:30 p.m.  </span></p>
<p><b>Series history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The teams have not met in the MaxPreps era (since 2004).</span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Two of the state’s best quarterbacks will face off in one of the most highly anticipated games of the year. Stanford-bound quarterback </span><b>Michael Mitchell Jr.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has been undoubtedly the Bay Area’s best player, throwing for 3,471 yards and 46 touchdowns while completing 67.7% of his throws. Mitchell has an All-Star cast of receivers, a group that includes </span><b>Cynai Thomas</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (Oregon State commit), </span><b>Judge Nash</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (Harvard) and three-star pass catcher </span><b>Perrion Williams</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Riordan has two blue chip offensive lineman in Oregon commit </span><b>Tommy Tofi</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Michael Langi</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. On the defensive side, can Riordan stop Folsom quarterback </span><b>Ryder Lyons</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. The senior has been a star since he became Folsom&#8217;s starting quarterback as a sophomore. In 12 games this season, Lyons has thrown for 3,270 yards and 34 touchdowns. His favorite target – four-star receiver </span><b>Jameson Williams</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> – has caught 72 passes for 13 touchdowns. Riordan is appearing in its first NorCal game. Folsom will be playing in its 11th, seeking its sixth title.</span></p>
<p><b>Computer projection: </b><a href="http://hsratings.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">HSRatings.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> picks Folsom to win 34-31.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<p><b>DIVISION 1-A: CENTRAL EAST-FRESNO VS. PITTSBURG</b></p>
<p><b>Records: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Central East 12-1, Pittsburg 11-2</span></p>
<p><b>Kickoff: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday at Pittsburg, 6 p.m. </span></p>
<p><b>Series history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The teams have not faced off in the MaxPreps era (since 2004).</span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This game is primed for fireworks as both teams have prolific offenses. Pittsburg, loaded with speed and athleticism, demolished Cardinal Newman 42-17 in the North Coast Section Division I final last week. For a majority of the season, the Pirates have used a two-quarterback system composed of sophomore dual-threat </span><b>JaVale Jones</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (1,338 yards, 15 touchdowns) and pinpoint passer </span><b>Carlos Torres</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> (2,387 yards, 29 TDs). Whoever is under center will have plenty of options to throw to with Arizona-bound </span><b>RJ Mosely</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, senior </span><b>King Wade</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and speedy sophomore </span><b>Kenneth Ward</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Pittsburg’s defense is playing its best ball as of late, led by linebacker <strong>Japheth Tofaeono</strong>, Fresno State-bound defensive back <strong>Truly Bell</strong> and senior defensive end <strong>Trevon West</strong>. But stopping Central East will be a tall task. Arizona-bound running back </span><b>Brandon Smith</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has 35 touchdowns and 2,334 all-purpose yards this season. </span><b>Jelani Dippel</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has thrown for 4,096 yards and 52 touchdowns. The Bengals ran through the Central Section Division I playoffs, outscoring their opponents – Clovis East, Buchanan and Clovis – 179-87. </span></p>
<p><b>Computer projection: </b><a href="http://hsratings.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">HSRatings.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> picks Central East to win 44-38.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<p><b>DIVISION 2-AA: SERRA VS. ST. MARY’S-STOCKTON</b></p>
<p><b>Records: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Serra 8-5, St. Mary’s 11-2</span></p>
<p><b>Kickoff: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Friday at St. Mary’s, 7:30 p.m. </span></p>
<p><b>Series history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Serra is 1-2 against St. Mary’s in the MaxPreps era (2004 to present), beating the Rams 56-28 in 2019, and dropping back-to-back games in 2016 and 2017. </span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Serra represented the North in the Open Division state championship game from 2021 to 2023 but hasn&#8217;t appeared in a NorCal regional since 2019. The Padres&#8217; losses this season have come against heavyweights Folsom, De La Salle, St. John Bosco and Riordan twice. In its win over Los Gatos last week for the CCS Division I title, Serra leaned on its running game, throwing just one pass. The Padres have a stable of backs who contribute: </span><b>Iziah Singleton</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><b>Jeovanni Henley</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Andrew Takapautolo</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, with even four-star safety </span><b>Malakai Taufoou</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> making plays in the run game. St. Mary’s is one of the Sac-Joaquin Section&#8217;s storied programs under longtime coach Tony Franks. The Rams have found numerous ways to win during their postseason run, defeating Jesuit 64-55, Manteca 19-14 and Granite Bay 38-24 to reach the regionals. UCLA-bound receiver </span><b>Kenneth Moore III</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has 1,724 all-purpose yards and 17 touchdowns for the Rams.</span></p>
<p><b>Computer projection: </b><a href="http://hsratings.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">HSRatings.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> predicts a 35-31 win for Serra. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Nathan Canilao</span></i></p>
<p><b>DIVISION 3-AA: ST. IGNATIUS VS. MONTE VISTA</b></p>
<p><b>Records: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Monte Vista 8-5, St. Ignatius 7-6</span></p>
<p><b>Kickoff: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Friday at St. Ignatius, 7 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Series history:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The teams have not met in the MaxPreps era (since 2004).</span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">St. Ignatius will try to reach a state championship game after capturing its second straight section title. Last season, the Wildcats lost to Central-Fresno 33-23 in a NorCal regional after winning the CCS Open Division championship. This time, they’ll face another Bay Area team as Monte Vista has heated up at the right time. St. Ignatius got a game-changing pick-six from linebacker </span><b>Charlie Ball</b> in last week&#8217;s CCS Division II final against Sacred Heart Cathedral<span style="font-weight: 400">, plus a walk-off 40-yard field goal from </span><b>Thomas McKeon </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and a 91-yard kickoff-return touchdown from </span><b>Hawkes Packard</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Monte Vista found success on the ground in its NCS Division II championship game win over Clayton Valley, as </span><b>Torin Dunphy </b><span style="font-weight: 400">rushed for 129 of his team&#8217;s 226 rushing yards. QB </span><b>Ian Ondricek </b><span style="font-weight: 400">had 60 yards on the ground and completed 3 of 4 passes for 60 yards. </span></p>
<p><b>Computer projection: </b><a href="http://hsratings.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">HSRatings.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> projects SI will win 28-17.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Christian Babcock</span></i></p>
<p><b>DIVISION 3-A: ROSEVILLE VS. MCCLYMONDS</b></p>
<p><b>Records: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Roseville 11-2, McClymonds 10-2</span></p>
<p><b>Kickoff: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday at McClymonds, 6 p.m.</span></p>
<p><b>Series history: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The teams have not met in the MaxPreps era (since 2004).</span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Oakland Section champion McClymonds is back in a NorCal title game once again. Quarterback </span><b>Berell Staples</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> has been a steady presence for the Warriors as the Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo commit brings two years of experience. After sitting out most of the season with an injury, </span><b>Rahsjon Duncan</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> is back playing wide receiver and cornerback. Wide receiver </span><b>Prince Staten</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and running back</span><b> Dominic Davis</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> complete McClymonds’ explosive offensive attack. On defense, look for McClymonds to lean on San Diego State-bound lineman </span><b>Koi Taiesei</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Roseville averages 31 points per game. The Tigers defeated Escalon, Hughson and East Union-Manteca en route to the SJS Division IV title. Senior quarterback </span><b>Mason Susnara</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> leads Roseville’s attack. </span></p>
<p><b>Computer projection: </b><a href="http://hsratings.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">HSRatings.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> picks Roseville to win 21-17.</span></p>

<p><b>Series history:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The teams have not faced off in the MaxPreps era (since 2004).</span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This matchup pits a pair of teams riding high after winning in their respective Division III section championship games. El Cerrito won North Coast Section D-III after being Dublin, Rancho Cotate and Ukiah by at least 11 points apiece. M-A started the season 0-4 before rallying to finish tied for second in the Peninsula Athletic League Bay Division. The Bears have a senior dual-threat quarterback in </span><b>Teddy Dacey</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and a strong running back in</span><b> Evaimalo Ama</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. El Cerrito has rebounded from a difficult end to its season last year, when the Gauchos forfeited a number of games after playing ineligible players and weren&#8217;t in the playoffs. </span></p>

<p><b>Storylines: </b>O&#8217;Dowd sizzled through the NCS Division VI playoffs after finishing second to James Logan in the WACC Foothill Division. Coach Hardy Nickerson brings a young team to the regionals, led by junior running back <b>Lamar Ellis</b>, sophomore athlete <b>Bryan Edwards</b> and junior quarterback <b>Christian Cermenelli-Johnson</b>. Ellis and Edwards combined for eight touchdowns in a 59-21 rout of Fortuna last week. The Dragons have won eight of their past nine games. Chico reached the regional by winning the Northern Section Division II title, 28-20 over Foothill of Palo Cedro. <strong>Zaiveon Patrick</strong> ran for 175 of the winner&#8217;s 359 rushing yards in the section final. Chico passed for just six yards that game. O&#8217;Dowd, in its only previous regional, beat Capital Christian-Sacramento 24-21 for the 5-AA title in 2016.

<p><b>Series history:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The teams have not met in the MaxPreps era (since 2004).</span></p>
<p><b>Storylines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Piedmont Hills will try to keep the good times rolling after winning a CCS Division V title in coach Kelly King Jr.’s first season at the San Jose school. King also won a D-V title at Leland last year. But the Chargers’ season ended with a 42-11 loss to Moreau Catholic, an outcome King is determined to avoid this time around. Quarterback </span><b>John Palomo</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> had a strong day for the Pirates last week against Sobrato, completing 22 of 30 passes for 225 yards and four touchdowns. Piedmont Hills will try to slow down Balboa star </span><b>Mekai Smith</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who scored six TDs in the San Francisco City Section final last week against Washington.</span></p>
