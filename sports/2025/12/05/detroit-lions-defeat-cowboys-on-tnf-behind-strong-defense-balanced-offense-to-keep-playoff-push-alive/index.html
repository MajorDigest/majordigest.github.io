Lot of passing yards. About to do it again”<br>I asked can I quote you on that “sure” with a confident smile #Cowboys pic.twitter.com/XS0nw3OdNc</p>&mdash; Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) December 4, 2025</blockquote><p>That last game at <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Ford_Field/" target="_blank" rel=""><b>Ford Field</b></a> was in November 2019, when Prescott threw for 444 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-27
