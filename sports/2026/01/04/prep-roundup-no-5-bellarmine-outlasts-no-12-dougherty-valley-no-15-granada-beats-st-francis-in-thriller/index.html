    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">SAN JOSE — </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/ca/san-jose/bellarmine-college-prep-bells/basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bellarmine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> didn’t flinch when a scrappy </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/ca/san-ramon/dougherty-valley-wildcats/basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> team made its run in the second half. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At home on Saturday afternoon, the Bells answered the Wildcats’ second-half surge with poise to pull away with a </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/games/01-03-2026/basketball-25-26/bellarmine-college-prep-vs-dougherty-valley.htm?c=7pDCsSZxwEeICm-WXtRUmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">75-63 win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The game was one of the premier matchups at the Bay Area Challenge Showcase that pitted some of the top teams in the East Bay Athletic League against a few of the best programs in the West Catholic Athletic League. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The EBAL and the WCAL are regarded as the top basketball leagues in the Bay Area. Bellarmine is ranked fifth in the latest </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/23/high-school-boys-basketball-rankings-dec-23-2025-bay-area-news-group-top-20/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bay Area News Group rankings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> while Dougherty Valley holds the 12th spot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chico State-bound guard Will Corbett scored 20 points and dished out eight assists to lead Bellarmine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bellarmine jumped out to a fast start before Dougherty Valley clawed its way back in the second half. But timely contributions from seniors Brennan Williams and Sofian Stringfellow helped Bellarmine regain control in the fourth quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a special win,” Bellarmine coach Alex Sarrett said. “I got a ton of respect for Mike Hanson. I think he&#8217;s a fantastic coach, and they&#8217;re going to do really well this year in their league. So for us to come down, finish out our preseason with that win, it&#8217;s a big deal for us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Williams also finished with 20 points and added three rebounds. Stringfellow had 16 points with four made 3-pointers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley guard Rashod Cotton Jr. led all scorers with 24 points. Junior Rylan Sevilla added 14 points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re a good team and at their place in a big event, this is kind of what I expected,” Dougherty Valley coach Mike Hansen said. “We&#8217;d have to make more shots in order to beat them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bells shot lights out in the first half, which helped them jump out to an early 33-19 lead after two quarters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after the halftime break, Dougherty Valley turned up the pressure on the San Jose school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Wildcats continued to double and triple team Corbett to get the ball out of his hands. The plan worked as the wiry guard scored just six points in the final two periods as the Wildcats briefly took a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Bellarmine adjusted just in time to take back control of the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A layup from Dougherty Valley sophomore Alonzo Walker cut the Bellarmine lead to four halfway through the fourth quarter. But from there it was all Bellarmine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bells finished the period on a 15-7 run on a barrage of buckets from Williams and Stringfellow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Williams’ steal and dunk with just under three minutes left in the game gave Bellarmine an eight-point lead and all but sealed the win for the San Jose school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bellarmine attributed the win to weathering Dougherty Valley’s run in the third quarter and adjusting when the Wildcats took away their top scorer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re going to see a lot of teams blitzing Will with the great player that he is,” Williams said. “So it’s just about having to step up, help him out and get some pressure off his back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sarrett added, “If they want to send two at Will, it&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;re just going to skip it over. Find another option.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The home team looked poised early as Bellarmine jumped out to a 16-5 lead after the first quarter. Bellarmine’s offense, powered by Corbett, easily sliced through the smaller Dougherty Valley defense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Corbett finished the first half 14 points, which included a thunderous one-handed dunk that drew oohs and aahs from the home crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley (11-5) will end its nonleague portion of its schedule on Tuesday when it plays Bishop O’Dowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bellarmine (8-2) will host its WCAL opener on Tuesday against St. Francis. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 2 Archbishop Riordan 67, Monte Vista 47</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mustangs hung around for three quarters, but Riordan proved to be too much in the end, cruising to a 20-point victory. </span><b>JP Pihtovs</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> scored 13 points, grabbed 18 rebounds and blocked three shots in the win. </span></p>

<p><b>No. 8 California 65, No. 3 St. Ignatius 64</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Grizzlies get their best win of the season by handing St. Ignatius its first loss of the season behind 33 points from Santa Clara-bound guard </span><b>Brayde Kuykendall</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. Kuykendall knocked in two free throws with under five seconds left to give California a one-point lead. The Grizzlies then got a key stop to ice the game. </span><b>Jaiden Jones</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, who along with Kuykendall accounted for every California basket in the fourth quarter, added 17 points. St. Ignatius’ </span><b>Noah Kirsch-Lopez</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> had a team-high 13 points. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 10 Amador Valley 57, St. Mary’s-Berkeley 54</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Junior point guard </span><b>Jaylen Smith</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> scored a game-high 22 points to lead Amador Valley to a close win over St. Mary’s. San Jose State commit </span><b>Cade Krueger</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Elijah Stanley</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> combined for 19 points in the win. </span><b>Donovan Mikel</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> led St. Mary’s with 14 points and </span><b>Malakai Kelley</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> added 12. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 14 Dublin 63, No. 19 Valley Christian 61</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Down seven players with illness and injuries, Dublin somehow found a way to pull out what coach Tom Costello described as “one of my best wins in my career.” Both teams played evenly until early in the fourth quarter when Dublin used a 13-2 run late in the third and early in the fourth to take an 11-point lead. Valley Christian clawed back into the game late, but time ran out and the Gaels hit just enough free throws to seal a solid nonleague win. </span><b>Nick Lee </b><span style="font-weight: 400">scored a game-high 26 points and grabbed four rebounds in the win. Senior transfer from Colorado </span><b>Izaiyah Romero</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> added 25 points. Valley Christian’s </span><b>Bryant Clark</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> led the Warriors with 19 points. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 15 Granada 64, St. Francis 59</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Matadors clawed their way back from the jaws of defeat down St. Francis. Granada trailed by eight with four minutes left in the fourth quarter, but ended the game on a 13-1 run to seal the victory. Junior </span><b>Brandon Hahn</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> turned in another monster performance, scoring 25 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. </span><b>Quaran Johnson Jr.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> came up big in the fourth quarter, scoring six of his seven points to spark Granada’s comeback. </span><b>Weston Edwards </b><span style="font-weight: 400">led St. Francis (7-3) with 17 points. Granada finished its non-league schedule 12-3 and will open EBAL play with Monte Vista on Friday. </span></p>

<p><b>Livermore 65, Sacred Heart Cathedral 40</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sophomore star </span><b>Amare Chandler</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> poured in 22 points and grabbed 16 rebounds to lead Livermore to a blowout win over SHC. </span><b>C.T. Harper</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> added 10 points and center </span><b>Dylan Wherry </b><span style="font-weight: 400">had nine. Saturday’s victory was Livermore’s first win over a WCAL team in the MaxPreps era (since 2004). </span></p>
<p><b>San Ramon Valley 63, St. Patrick-St. Vincent 47</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Wolves got back on track after losing three of their last four games with a comfortable win over SPSV. </span><b>Pierce Iattoni </b><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><b>Philip Hitchcock</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> each scored a game-high 15 points while </span><b>Tommy Ambidge</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> added 14. </span><b>Ronbie Rhymes </b><span style="font-weight: 400">had a game-high 29 points for SPSV. </span></p>
