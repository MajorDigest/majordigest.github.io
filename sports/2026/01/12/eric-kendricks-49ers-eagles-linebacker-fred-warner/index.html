    <p>I had a high school coach who once explained he expected players off the bench to give a lift to the team rather than just substitute for a starter.</p>
<p>That never made sense, given the reserve then should have actually been the starter.</p>
<p>I thought of that Sunday while watching Eric Kendricks play every snap of a 23-19 wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field.</p>
<p>This is no knock on Tatum Bethune, who was first in line to take over for Fred Warner after he sustained a broken and dislocated ankle which originally ruled him out for the season, although it now appears he could return if the 49ers advance to the NFC Championship Game.</p>
<p>That won&#8217;t happen Saturday when the 49ers (13-5) visit the Seattle Seahawks (14-3) in a divisional round game in a rematch of their regular-season finale.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s up to Kendricks to lead the 49ers defense through helmet communication with Robert Saleh. His 73 snaps were the most he has played since Week 14 in 2022, when he played 74 snaps for Minnesota in an overtime win over Indianapolis.</p>
<p>But given that Kendricks was signed to the 49ers&#8217; practice squad on Nov. 26 and played in only three regular-season games, he has more in the tank than usual at this point of the season.  After playing through a shoulder injury last season while leading the Dallas Cowboys in tackles, Kendricks, 33, was choosy about signing as a free agent in 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel great, my body feels great, Kendricks said at the post-game podium. &#8220;I just wanted to wait for the right opportunity with the right team. Nothing felt right until got here with all the leaders on this team. It just made the most sense. I was willing to take a role I had never taken before because this team is so unselfish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kendricks, 6-foot, 233 pounds, did more than just give veteran leadership. He led the 49ers with 11 tackles and on Philadelphia&#8217;s final offensive snap, adjusted defensively and knocked down a Jalen Hurts pass intended for tight end Dallas Goedert on fourth-and-11 from the 49ers&#8217; 21-yard line.</p>
<p>All due respect to Bethune, out for the season with a torn groin &#8212; but he&#8217;s still a young player. Primarily a run-stuffer, Bethune probably doesn&#8217;t make that play.</p>
<p>As well documented as the 49ers&#8217; injury issues have been, in some instances it provides an upgrade. That&#8217;s what Kendricks has done in the middle of the defense. And the fact that it happened on the road against the Eagles made it even more satisfying.</p>
<p>In five games in Philadelphia for the Minnesota Vikings and Dallas Cowboys, including playoffs, Kendricks was 1-4. That included a 38-7 divisional round playoff game in 2017 and a 41-7 loss as a member of the Cowboys last season.</p>
<p>The only win was in 2018, a 23-21 victory by the Vikings. Neither Kendricks nor Garret Wallow, who joined the 49ers off the Denver practice squad on Dec. 2, was around when Warner got hurt. Wallow missed just one snap and had 10 tackles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t won in Philly for a while,&#8221; Kendricks said. &#8220;It feels good for the soul. Gotta give a shoutout to Garret Wallow. I always judge linebackers based on, when things are super thick, when things aren&#8217;t going away, how well they&#8217;re able to communicate and stay calm. He checked all those boxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coach Kyle Shanahan made a prescient statement to his team during the week regarding Kendricks stepping in as the starter based on years of experience playing against him with Minnesota and Dallas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you guys, this guy is going to be ready,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;That was the vibe we&#8217;ve always had playing against him and that&#8217;s how he handled this whole week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kendricks got in extra film work and knowledge gained from assistant linebackers coach K.J. Wright, who looks to be an upwardly mobile career track after an 11-year career that ended in 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been kind of knocking on his meeting door, getting extra time since I got here,&#8221; Kendricks said. &#8220;I feel like he got me prepared. We went through a bunch of situations, watched a bunch of film. It&#8217;s been nice to bounce my old playbook off him and compare it to this new one. This is like my fourth defense, so it&#8217;s like compare and contrast and get rid of the stuff that doesn&#8217;t matter and lock in on new concepts.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Warner is doing everything he can to play &#8212; Shanahan said they don&#8217;t plan on practicing him this week &#8212; it will be up to Kendricks to run the defense. And if the 49ers beat Seattle and does return, there&#8217;s no guarantee Warner will be anything like he was at the time he was injured based on the severity of the injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready whenever they&#8217;re ready,&#8221; Warner said on Ryen Rusillo&#8217;s DraftKings podcast Friday. &#8220;There&#8217;s some T&#8217;s that have got to be crossed, some I&#8217;s that have to be dotted. If it were just up to me, I&#8217;d be out there against the Eagles, but unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that way. I have to make sure I&#8217;m checking all the boxes and everybody has to gie me the OK before they let me go out there. But I&#8217;m pushing, I&#8217;m training hard. I&#8217;m back to doing full football drills and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212; Linebackers Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quad), a special teams stalwart, worked out before the game but weren&#8217;t ready to play. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall Jr. (knee) never got as far as a pregame workout before being declared out.</p>
<p>&#8212; Marques Sigle&#8217;s play at safety means should be no rush to get Ji&#8217;Ayir Brown (hamstring) back on the field until he&#8217;s ready.</p>
<p>&#8212; Due to the short week of practice and a Saturday game, Shanahan did not hold his customary conference call Monday with local media.</p>
<p>&#8212; Saleh is available for Zoom interviews this week for head coaching positions if he chooses. The way his defense played didn&#8217;t hurt his candidacy, but Shanahan&#8217;s not sure if it helped either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saleh is that good anyway,&#8221; Shanahan said postgame. &#8220;So regardless of what happened today or what happens next week, it&#8217;s a matter of time for Saleh to say, ‘I’ll coach again.’”</p>

<p>A look at who played and how much in the 49ers&#8217; wild-card win over Philadelphia:</p>
<p><strong>73:</strong> Kendricks, safety Malik Mustapha and corners Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green played every defensive snap. Linebacker Garret Wallow missed just one.</p>
<p><strong>59:</strong> Purdy and the entire offensive line of Colton McKivitz, Dominick Puni, Spencer Burford and Jake Brendel played every offensive snap. Wide receiver Jauan Jennings missed just two.</p>

<p><strong>43:</strong> Tight end Jake Tonges reprised his role as the go-to tight end in the passing game when Kittle left for good after 13 snaps. Had one reception for 14 yards on three targets.</p>
<p><strong>40:</strong> Marques Sigle had played 10 snaps in his previous eight games before Ji&#8217;Ayir Brown departed with a hamstring strain. He retained his usual special teams load with 18 snaps. On offense, Demarcus Robinson also had 40 snaps, the most he&#8217;s had all season.</p>
<p><strong>34:</strong> Defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos played the most snaps he has in a game this season.</p>
<p><strong>4:</strong> Wide receiver Malik Turner played for the fourth time this season and was in the game during the end-of-half clock-burning fiasco. He played 13 special teams snaps as well.</p>
