<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Wolves stole a </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/games/01-23-2026/basketball-25-26/granada-vs-san-ramon-valley.htm?c=FB7rL1EhYU2I3L8Z1Ow9uw"><span style="font-weight: 400">70-64</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> overtime win just days after Granada had a statement victory over </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/01/20/amid-late-chaos-granada-survives-dougherty-valley-rally-to-notch-key-ebal-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">SRV (10-12, 3-2) outscored </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/ca/livermore/granada-matadors/basketball/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Granada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 14-8 in the overtime period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This team, they have composure and they execute,” SRV coach Brian Botteen said in a phone interview. “We got some clutch rebounds and made some clutch shots. That’s what this team has been doing and they’re scrappy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Tommy Ambidge</strong> led SRV with 22 points. Senior point guard <strong>Tyler Smith</strong> scored 18 points, <strong>Pierce Iattoni</strong> added 12 and <strong>Hudson Garcia</strong> had 11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">SRV led by as much as seven in the third quarter, but Granada’s offense turned a corner late in the second half. The Matadors got 27 points after halftime from stars <strong>Brandon Hahn</strong> and <strong>Damien Miles</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A last-second foul gave the Matadors a chance to win the game at the free throw line, but the Livermore school hit just one of two shots, forcing overtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, it was all SRV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Nate Dessoye</strong>, who hadn’t scored all game, poured in five points and hit three crucial free throws to lift SRV in OT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The win catapulted SRV back into the postseason mix. The Wolves came into EBAL play with just seven wins and will need to finish with a .500 record overall, in league play or against Division I opponents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With four league games remaining, the Wolves have a heightened sense of urgency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re fighting for our lives to play and make the playoffs,” Botteen said. “We&#8217;ve had some rough growing pains for a team that really returns only one player that played about six minutes a game last season. So they&#8217;ve learned how to play and how to compete, and how to make up for some deficiencies that maybe we don&#8217;t have against other teams.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granada (15-6, 2-3) got 25 points from Hahn and 16 points from Miles. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 2 Archbishop Riordan 61, Valley Christian 44</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This matchup was stopped in the second quarter when Valley Christian center <strong>Teniola Bamisebi</strong> took a hard fall and remained down on the floor for an extended period of time. Trainers attended to Bamisebi for nearly 20 minutes, and VC athletic director Ryan Realini confirmed to the Bay Area News Group that paramedics were called and Bamisebi was taken to the hospital as a precaution. Realini said Bamisebi has total control of his extremities and added, “We feel good he will be OK.” Both teams warmed up once Bamisebi left the court and eventually restarted the game, which Riordan led 9-8 with 7:39 remaining in the second quarter. Bamisebi had seven of VC’s eight points and was still the Warriors’ leading scorer at halftime when they trailed 23-17. </span><b>Emmanuel Ahamefule</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>CJ Ani</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> each had nine points in the win. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 4 Archbishop Mitty 56, Sacred Heart Cathedral 46</b></p>
