    <p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the 11th consecutive time, the Battle of San Ramon belonged to </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/ca/san-ramon/dougherty-valley-wildcats/basketball/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind a 28-point performance from Rashod Cotton Jr., Dougherty Valley defeated crosstown rival California </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/games/01-27-2026/basketball-25-26/california-vs-dougherty-valley.htm?c=rgnMSRwP_0eX5gi4FaHscg"><span style="font-weight: 400">55-53</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley coach Mike Hansen improved to 23-2 against </span><a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/ca/san-ramon/california-grizzlies/basketball/"><span style="font-weight: 400">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in his career with Tuesday’s win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re 23-2 in my career against them. So, I mean, you know, I look at it as the next game on the schedule. Our kids obviously look at it as a big game,” Hansen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even being undersized at nearly every position, Hansen has completely leaned into a small-ball lineup that included four guards and forward Alonzo Walker III playing center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walker finished with 12 points, junior Rylan Sevilla had 10 and Devyn Ranola had five. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re really hard to guard because you beat yourself up trying to get big and they gotta think about guarding us too,” Hansen said. “You put four guys around Alonzo that can all penetrate, pitch and find and score, it&#8217;s really hard to guard us. So if our small lineup could rebound, it&#8217;s really tough. But I think down the stretch here, we&#8217;re gonna have to go a little bigger, just in spurts. But there&#8217;s a good part about being big, but there&#8217;s also the aspect of having to guard people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">California, which has now lost five of its last six games, got 15 points from Santa Clara commit Brayde Kuykendall and 11 points each from Jaiden Jones and Emeka Ifediora. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dougherty Valley (16-7, 4-2) will hit the road on Friday when the Wildcats play Amador Valley, which defeated Monte Vista on Tuesday. California (11-12, 2-4) will host Foothill. </span></p>
<p><b>No. 1 Salesian 57, Albany 35</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stanford commit </span><b>Elias Obenyah </b><span style="font-weight: 400">scored a team-high 13 points and </span><b>Braylon Franklin</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> added 10 to lead Salesian to a blowout Tri-County Athletic League Rock Division victory on the road over Albany.

<p><b>Livermore 44, No. 4 De La Salle 41 (suspended) </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This game was suspended with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter with Livermore leading by three as a fight in the gym’s hallway forced police intervention and the stoppage of the contest. The game will be resumed at a later date, according to school officials. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Read more about the incident </span></i><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/01/27/livermore-de-la-salle-suspend-boys-basketball-game-over-fight-in-gym-building/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></i></p>
