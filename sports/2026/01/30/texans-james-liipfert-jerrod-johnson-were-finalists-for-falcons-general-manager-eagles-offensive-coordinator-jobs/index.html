    <p>Texans assistant beneral manager James Liipfert was a strong contender for the Atlanta Falcons’ general manager job that ultimately went to Chicago Bears executive Ian Cunningham.</p><p>A Georgia native and former Georgia Tech linebacker Liipfert was a finalist who interviewed with team officials in Atlanta. The Falcons officially hired Cunningham, previously a candidate for the team president job that went to Matt Ryan, Thursday night.</p><p>Liipfert has been instrumental with general manager Nick Caserio in the construction of the Texans’ roster on several key decisions, especially with draft picks like All-Pro defensive end Will Anderson Jr. and All-Pro corner Derek Stingley Jr.</p><p>Liipfert is expected to continue in his same role with the Texans’ scouting department.</p><p>Texans quarterbacks coach Jerrod Johnson was a finalist for the Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator job, per sources, that went to Sean Mannion.</p><p>Now, Johnson is expected, per sources, to remain with the AFC South franchise.</p><p>This marks the second time Johnson has interviewed with the Eagles.</p><p>Johnson was previously a candidate for the Miami Dolphins’ offensive coordinator job that went to former Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik.</p><p>Johnson has interviewed for several offensive coordinator positions in the past.</p><p>He has coached Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud since he was in high school at the Elite 11 competition. Stroud, a former NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, had a rough playoffs with five interceptions and five forced fumbles, but his overall body of work has been successful and included three playoff wins and eight interceptions this past regular season.</p><p>“It’s pretty cool, man,” Johnson told KPRC 2. “I never take my job, my situation that I’m in, my relationship with C.J. for granted. He’s a special young man, and I think we have a special relationship. Just to see him get better every week, to see his growth from then to now and just to know the potential that he has, I think the sky’s the limit. </p><p>“Whatever is the best version of himself, we’re chasing that every single day to push him to there, He works really hard, he cares. The sky’s the limit for him.”</p><p>Johnson, 37, has coached Stroud, a 24-year-old former Pro Bowl selection, second overall pick, two-time Heisman Trophy finalist and consensus All-American, for his first three NFL seasons.</p><p>During the past eight years, Johnson’s career has taken off.</p><p>The former record-setting Texas A&amp;M quarterback and Humble native has gone from Bill Walsh fellowships with the San Francisco 49ers and Colts to a full-time quality control coach with the Colts, an assistant quarterbacks coach with the Minnesota Vikings and the lead quarterbacks coach with his hometown NFL team since Stroud was drafted three years ago.</p><p>“Me being a kid back then, being 16 years old, meeting him, and now being 24, it’s crazy,” Stroud said. “It’s almost ten years ago. It’s wild. Just to see not only my growth, but his and our relationship grow, he’s somebody who I consider a great friend and somebody I know I can call. I’ve seen him grow as a coach and see him have his fingerprint in our system, finally, after a couple years he’s able to put some input into plays.</p><p>“I thought he’s done a great job of that. Coaching me on footwork, he’s a mechanical genius. He’s a guru when it comes to footwork and being centered in the ground, with your wrist, all that good stuff. I’m very grateful and happy to have him as a coach.”</p><p>When Stroud wasn’t a well-known quarterback initially at Elite 11, he wound up outperforming his friend, Carolina Panthers quarterback and top overall pick Bryce Young. That caught the eyes of recruiters, including Ohio State coach Ryan Day.</p><p>Johnson encouraged Stroud to believe in himself, and be confident in his skills.</p><p>“Jerrod’s one thing for me was like, ‘Be confident,’” Stroud said. “At that time, I wasn’t really the highest recruit. I wasn’t who I would become. Jerrod is someone I looked up to. When he was like, ‘Man, you need to be more confident,’ it changed my life.”</p><p>Texans quarterbacks coach Jerrod Johnson’s jersey retired at Humble High School</p><p>Johnson, 37, played quarterback for six different NFL teams. He interviewed for the Texans’ offensive coordinator job before they hired Nick Caley as the replacement for former offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik.</p><p>Johnson has previously interviewed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New Orleans Saints, Cleveland Browns, Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots for offensive coordinator vacancies.</p><p>The Texans have seen Johnson continue to make advancements in his development as a coach.</p><p>“Jerrod has done a great job this year,” Ryans said. “I’ve definitely seen growth in him as a coach and how he’s done a better job of working with the quarterbacks. He’s given those guys a lot of pointers, a lot of tips, especially from him being a guy who played the position.</p><p>“He’s coached the position, helped a lot of young guys throughout his career. I’m very pleased with Jerrod and excited to see his growth as a coach over this past year. I think he’s doing a great job.”</p><p>Johnson emerged as a popular offensive coordinator candidate in the league before remaining with the Texans under an upgraded contract that included a higher salary two years ago.</p><p>“I aspire, absolutely,” Johnson said. “I think every coach aspires to get to that point. The cool thing is that you don’t go in there without winning. It’s a team game. </p><p>“I grew up playing, and I’m here to help the quarterbacks get better. If you do a good job, good things will happen. I pour into the players. I pour into the coaches, and that’s all that matters right now.”</p><p>Stroud became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game as a rookie, surpassing his childhood idol, Michael Vick. He began his career with an NFL record 191 passes without an interception, finished the season with 198 passes without an interception and finished with 4,108 yards in the regular season, 23 touchdowns and five interceptions.</p><p>Stroud joined Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to lead the league in passing yards per game and touchdown-to-interception ratio.</p><p>A former record-setting Texas A&amp;M quarterback who also played for the Aggies basketball team, Johnson embraces this opportunity as the Humble High School graduate coaches for his hometown team.</p><p>“I see myself as a teacher,” Johnson said. “My biggest thing is I want to teach. Whatever I can do to teach and give them whatever they need, I try to be transparent and open and honest with them. I really want feedback from them. It’s a joy to coach them.”</p><p>His background in Humble is what built Johnson into a coach.</p><p>“It meant everything,” Johnson said. “My dad was a coach there, and a principal there. That’s our family roots. I wouldn’t be who I am today without the village of people who raised me in Humble, Texas. I’m forever indebted to Humble and I love my hometown and that’s the foundation of who I am as a person.”</p><p>Coaching for his hometown team is emotionally significant for Johnson as he and his wife, Braidee, are the parents of a baby girl. Jersie Drew Johnson.</p><p>“It’s really special, especially with my family, my wife Braidee and our little girl, for me to get the opportunity to do what I love in the city that I grew up in,” Johnson said. “It’s a dream come true. I’m really blessed. It’s an emotional thing to be around my family and have our family around. For us to start our family in my hometown is a godsend.”</p><p>Liipfert was previously the executive director of player personnel and the assistant director of personnel/director of college scouting before being promoted to assistant general manager last year along with Chris Blanco.</p><p>Liipfert previously worked for the New England Patriots for nine years, spending three years as a national scout before being hired as the Texans’ director of college scouting.</p><p>Initially hired by New England as a scouting assistant in 2009, Liipfert was an area scout for the Patriots for five years.</p><p>He was hired after finishing up a college football career at Georgia Tech, where he was a three-year letterman at linebacker and on special teams after walking on and earning a scholarship.</p><p>The Georgia native was an all-state selection in high school where he played fullback and linebacker. He was named Region Player of the Year.</p><p>“I have a lot of respect for James,” said Texans general manager Nick Caserio, who worked with Liipfert in New England. “I’ve known him a long time. Probably known him as long as anybody in this building. Hired him as a scouting assistant. Finished his career at Georgia Tech. He hadn’t been involved in scouting, probably didn’t have much of an NFL career ahead of him. He knew that.</p><p>“He wanted to get involved in football, so I hired him as a scouting assistant and he’s grown, done a great job. Great person, great family. Works really hard. I rely on him for a lot. He’s earned his opportunity, so credit to him. Whatever the Falcons decide to do, but hopefully he’s here helping the Texans. He’s fortunate to have the opportunity and I’m sure he’ll do a good job with it. Happy for James and see how it goes.”</p><p><i>Aaron Wilson is a Texans and NFL reporter for KPRC 2 and </i><a href="https://click2houston.com" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://click2houston.com"><i>click2houston.com</i></a> </p>
