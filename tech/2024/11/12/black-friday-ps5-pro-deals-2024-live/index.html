<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""></a>The Black Friday PS5 Pro deals will become part of the wider PS5 deals we'll see later this month, and there should be a host of discounts on offer to PS5 Pro owners.</p><p>â€¢ See all of today's best deals at Amazon</p><p>While the PS5 Pro is brand new and we can't expect too much in the way of discounts on the machine itself, we're hopeful of seeing some tempting propositions on accessories and games that are adjacent to it. After all, every PS5 accessory and game is usable and playable on the Pro.</p><p>We're also quietly hoping for some more value offerings on the PS5 Pro too: perhaps some bundles that include the disc drive and vertical stand at a reduced retail price. This would increase the value proposition and help offer a way into the new console in a more fulsome way - and with it being so hard to buy a PS5 disc drive right now, this would be incredibly welcome.</p><p>Anyway, be it such bundles, discounts on the best enhanced PS5 Pro games, or other products that will enhance your PS5 Pro experience, we're here to gather up all the best deals as we steamroll our way to Black Friday later this month.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to our coverage of this year's Black Friday PS5 Pro deals and sales. if you've been looking for a place to browse for deals on the new Pro console itself (hopefully) or any of the best enhanced games, or accessories to team with your PS5 Pro then you're in the right place.</p><p>While we're hopeful, but not expectant, of some better value offerings on the Pro itself - perhaps via bundles that include extras like the disc drive - we're definitely going to see price cuts on some top games, as well as a plethora of accessories from TVs to headsets, and from controllers to storage.</p><p>I recently reviewed the PS5 Pro so know a thing or two about it and what it can offer you - and what it needs to be better value - and I've also been a PlayStation and gaming hardware editor and writer for years, covering the PS5 launch and stock shortage, and the PlayStation Portal stock debacle too, to name a couple of examples. Importantly, though, I'm also another PlayStation-head who loves to save money on games and accessories so I know what makes a good PS5 Pro deal and PS5 discount. So sit back, and let's begin.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-black-friday-ps5-pro-deals-will-we-see-2">What kind of Black Friday PS5 Pro deals will we see? </h3>
<p>Particularly given the PS5 Pro is so fresh and brand new, you may be wondering what kind of deals I'm going to be concentrating on here - which is a fair question!</p><p>While I don't necessarily expect to see any discounts on the console itself, I am just a tiny bit hopeful of seeing some better value offerings on it. I'd really love to see some retailers bundle up the disc drive and vertical stand with the Pro and shave some money off the price tag, for example. These kinds of bundles will still be expensive, of course, but might be enough to convince folks to jump in and get everything they need in one hit.</p><p>Adjacent to the console itself, on things like PS5 Pro games, and PS5 Pro accessories, is <em>definitely</em> where we are going to see discounts and deals galore. PlayStation first-party games, and major games of the past couple of years which are Pro enhanced will drop in price , so look out for discounts on the likes of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, the <em>Horizon</em> games, and <em>Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart</em> (and more).</p><p>Then we're <em>definitely</em> going to see discounts on accessories and complementing hardware to the PS5 Pro too. Headsets, controllers, SSDs, racing wheels, TVs, monitors, and everything else will have prices slashed so look out for those - and we'll be highlighting a bunch here - throughout the sales period.</p>

<p>Having said that, the first price I need to tell you about is the best price on the PS5 Pro itself right now.</p><p>In the US, the best price we can find is a mere 99 cents off the listing price of $699.99. It's not really a discount at this point, but getting the PS5 Pro for $699 at Walmart remains your best bet basically, at least right now.</p><p>However, folks in the UK have it ever so slightly better with the EE Store continuing its trend of shaving pounds off even the latest gaming gear. Right now, folks can pick up the PS5 Pro for Â£695 at the EE Store which is a whole Â£4.99 off the MSRP of the console. A small win, but a win nonetheless. However, we have spotted something else for UK shoppers that might be of interest if you're prepared to wait a couple of weeks...</p>
<h3 id="uk-retailer-very-is-selling-a-ps5-pro-disc-drive-bundle-2">UK retailer Very is selling a PS5 Pro + disc drive bundle!</h3>

<p>This is the bundle we've been hoping for since it was confirmed that the PS5 Pro came without a disc drive. You can now get the PS5 Pro + disc drive for Â£794 at Very. This bundle also saves you about six pounds from the combined listing prices, but it's a very welcome first bundle of its kind that we've seen.</p>
