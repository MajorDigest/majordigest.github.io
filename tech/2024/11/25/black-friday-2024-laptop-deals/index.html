Generally speaking, this isn't the cheapest MacBook deal I've seen (you can get the M2 for $799) but it's probably the one I'd spring for right now if it were my own cash I was laying down.

<p>With Black Friday now fast approaching, Black Friday laptop deals are coming in thick and fast, so we've overhauled this guide to give you live buying advice and highlighting the best deals as they pop up.</p><p>Buying a new laptop at any time of the year is a big consideration, and during sales events like Black Friday, you might feel a bit lost or overwhelmed, with all kinds of specs and jargon flying around. How can you tell what's a genuinly good deal, and what's not? I'm here to help, and I'll be checking out laptop deals from Amazon, Best Buy, Currys and Argos – plus loads more.</p>

<p>Let's start with a bit of buying advice. Before buying a new laptop, have a clear idea of what your budget is and what you want to use the laptop for. There are a lot of different types of laptop out there, so knowing what kind will suit your needs will make things a lot easier.</p><p>You'll likely see laptops fall into three main categories: laptops, Chromebooks and MacBooks.</p><p>Laptops are usually Windows 11 devices, and these come in all shapes and sizes. There are plenty of budget laptops out there that are good picks for people who just need something to browse the web and write up documents. There are also powerful gaming laptops, premium thin and light laptops, 2-in-1 devices and more.</p>

<p>So, let's kick off with some awesome early Black Friday deals on laptops. Now that we are only a few days away from the big day itself, prices are steadily dropping - and in some cases, I can't see prices going much lower on November 29 (the day Black Friday lands on), so it's safe to jump on any of these deals.</p><p>As usual, Dell has got some great Black Friday deals on, like its Inspiron 15 laptop that comes with a 12th gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of strorage for just $470. That's an excellent price for a well-built and reliable everyday laptop.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-15-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-3520-laptop/nn3520gskhs?cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXww&cjevent=a72bf694ab2511ef81ff02990a18b8f6&dgc=CJ&publisherid=3486349&publisher=&aff=Future+Publishing+Limited&affid=3486349&aff_webid=6361382&aff_user_id=trd-gb-6829263706888156736&gacd=9684992-28463632-5750457-345576786-177846717&dgc=af&VEN1=12578053-6361382-trd-gb-6829263706888156736-Future%20Publishing%20Limited&dclid=CKevlfa494kDFX9mpAQdHmQ6MQ"><strong>Dell Inspiron 15 laptop:</strong> <del>was $699</del> <strong>now $469.99</strong> <strong>at Dell</strong></a></p>

<p>If you're in the UK, then Dell has the excellent Inspiron 16 laptop for sale with a big £170 discount. This gets you an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage, plus a lovely large 16-inch screen to work on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/laptops-2-in-1-pcs/inspiron-16-laptop/spd/inspiron-16-5645-laptop/bn56403sb"><strong>Dell Inspiron 16 laptop:</strong> <del>was £749</del> <strong>now £579</strong> <strong>at Dell</strong></a></p>

<p>Next, there are Chromebooks. These are usually much cheaper than Windows 11 laptops, and also boast impressively long battery lives, making them ideal for students in particular.</p><p>Chromebooks run Chrome OS, rather than Windows 11, which is a lightweight operating system based on Google's Chrome browser. Chrome OS has evolved over the years, and there are lots of apps available for all kinds of tasks.</p><p>When I say Chrome OS is lightweight, what I mean by that is that it is designed for efficiency over power and features. This allows it to run on less powerful hardware than other operating systems which is why Chromebooks are often a lot cheaper than other laptops, and why their batteries last longer. The downside is that this does mean Chromebooks don't come with all the features you'd expect from traditional laptops, and many apps that you can use in Windows 11 or macOS don't work in Chrome OS - though there are usually alternatives. We've got a dedicated guide to the best Black Friday Chromebook deals if you feel these are the best type of laptop for your needs.</p>

<p>Over in the Chromebook department, there are some super-cheap ChromeOS laptops available right now thanks to Black Friday sales at a range of retailers.</p><p>First up is this HP Chromebook 15, which is cheaper than half-price at Best Buy right now thanks to a hefty $220 reduction - an excellent deal for a laptop that was already pretty good value for money.</p><p>Equipped with an Intel N200 CPU and 8GB of RAM, it's not going to run all the latest games and dazzle you with its graphical performance, but if you're looking for a straightforward workhorse laptop for everyday tasks like answering emails and browsing the web, this is a solid pick. Thanks to the low hardware requirements of ChromeOS, you should have a smooth experience.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-15-6-chromebook-laptop-intel-processor-n200-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-natural-silver/6535992.p?skuId=6535992" target="_blank"><strong>HP Chromebook 15:</strong> <del>was $399</del> <strong>now $179</strong> <strong>at Best Buy</strong></a></p>

<p>Chromebook hunters over in the UK will also be able to take advantage of some hearty Black Friday discounts - like this HP Chromebook Plus 15, which is down to £279 (a saving of £170) at Currys right now.</p><p>'Plus' Chromebooks are usually a bit pricier, but also adhere to a strict set of requirements laid down by Google to provide the best possible ChromeOS laptop experience. These include a certain level of processing power - delivered here by the Intel Core i3 chip - as well as minimum requirements for the RAM and storage capacity plus a mandatory Full HD webcam. All these features combined inside HP's unassuming Chromebook chassis make for a solid productivity laptop for any office worker or student.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/hp-15anb0502sa-15.6-chromebook-plus-intel-core-i3-128-gb-ssd-silver-10250776.html" target="_blank"><strong>HP Chromebook Plus 15:</strong> <del>was £449</del> <strong>now £279</strong> <strong>at Currys</strong></a></p>

<p>For anyone looking for a more premium Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 is an excellent choice right now - almost a third off at Amazon. This Chromebook features a 12th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, Full HD touchscreen, and 360-degree hinge for swapping into tablet mode (with a garaged stylus too!) for a more versatile laptop experience.</p><p>I'd call the $749.99 entry price for this Acer Chromebook a bit steep - given that Chromebooks are meant to be affordable alternatives to Windows laptops - but cut down to $529 for Black Friday, it's an absolute bargain. You're getting a clean and premium design with fast performance for almost a third off the retail price, and I love to see it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Chromebook-CP714-1WN-53M9-i5-1235U-1920x1200-Keyboard/dp/B0BJH9LGK8?th=1" target="_blank"><strong>Acer Chromebook Spin 714:</strong> <del>was $749.99</del> <strong>now $529</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>UK browsers can enjoy a nice discount on that Acer Chromebook Spin 714 too - not quite as large a reduction as seen over in the US, but still a very respectable £150 off at Currys - and this model packs a larger 512GB SSD, too, letting you download and store more apps and files locally.</p><p>Anyone who wants to use ChromeOS but doesn't want to compromise at all on the feature set and build quality of their laptop should definitely give this one a look. With a 1200p touchscreen, strong port selection, and a smart stylus that quick-charges when slotted back inside the chassis, this is the perfect Chromebook for the busy professional on the go.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/acer-spin-714-14-2-in-1-chromebook-intel-core-i5-512-gb-ssd-grey-10251700.html" target="_blank"><strong>Acer Chromebook Spin 714:</strong> <del>was £799</del> <strong>now £649</strong> <strong>at Currys</strong></a></p>

<p>Then there are MacBooks. These laptops are made by Apple and run the macOS operating system. While macOS does things a bit differently from Windows 11, you shouldn't worry if you're making the leap, as you'll soon get accustomed to its user interface - and pretty much any program you use in Windows 11 will have a macOS version - even Microsoft products like Microsoft Office.</p><p>Currently, there are two main types of MacBook - the thin, light and affordable MacBook Air, and the much more powerful (and expensive) MacBook Pro. However, each of these actually come in various sizes and specifications.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air M1 is a few years old by this point, but it is still a powerhouse of a laptop, especially for one as light and portable as it is (and quiet too, thanks to its fanless cooling).</p><p>Powered by first-generation Apple Silicon (the Apple M1 chip), this laptop absolutely changed the game when it came to laptop performance and longevity, with some of the best battery life you're going to find anywhere on the market.</p><p>This configuration, available now at Walmart, features the 8-core version of the Apple M1 chip, 8GB unified memory, a 256GB PCIe SSD, and a 13.3-inch Retina display. The Rose Gold colorway is sold out, but you can still get it in Silver and Space Gray, all for the lowest price I've ever seen for an M1 MacBook Air.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889"><strong>Apple MacBook Air M1: </strong><del>was $699</del><strong> now $599 at Walmart</strong></a></p>

<p>In my opinion, the best deal right now for a MacBook Air is this one from Amazon:</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DLHWLTQN?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1"><strong>MacBook Air 13-inch (M3): </strong><del>was $1,099</del><strong> now $844</strong></a></p><p>Why is this so good? For a start, that big price cut gets it below $900, making an already fantastic-value MacBook even better value.</p><p>This deal is also for the new model of the MacBook Air - so you get the M3 chip, currently the most powerful chip in a MacBook Air, as well as 16GB of unified memory. This means it's an excellent buy for students or people looking for a thin and light MacBook that will last for years.</p>

<p>In the UK, the same model gets a £150 price cut. Not quite as good as the offer our US cousins get, but you're again getting a gorgeous thin and light laptop with plenty of memory and powerful M3 chip at a price that puts a lot of Windows laptops to shame.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX233L4S/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2VX72MNP936UA&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UysTlyflwv4qgGOaRiW0wAjfsjKhjGu9fddpaRsRX9TKibDkEUWBF8NKKLGnM4PjJGazCvdSGEtqHAj3sUqRE8OmhviWN2YDjSlAfnzR_ST8Ig6hSfW0uBtiO0vmyAaWfWQjxB_NNfNkaTqkcoHYQ7Y-B7XhqEyit51B9J6XRStbdiin2fTC3BKfyj7J7vcVyogpoUj9tSYj1xMRhQYjuh9IyEEnxtB5z2XUwIJ3eV8.tHcaRFXZ4APJa-Ym2kG2MsQdDU0cz-g7WvFuSZ5fMXk&dib_tag=se&keywords=macbook%2Bair&qid=1732539340&sprefix=macbook%2Bair%2Caps%2C112&sr=8-2&ufe=INHOUSE_INSTALLMENTS%3AUK_IHI_5M_APPLE&th=1"><strong>MacBook Air 13-inch (M3): </strong><del>was £999</del><strong> now £849</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="should-you-buy-a-macbook-air-2">Should you buy a MacBook Air?</h3>
<p>When it comes to the MacBook Air, the latest model comes with an M3 chip, 16GB of unified memory and 256GB SSD to start. This is available in two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch. The M3 chip is an excellent all-round performer, and the choice in screen size will depend on what you feel most comfortable working on, with the smaller model offering more portability.</p><p>Apple also continues to officially sell the MacBook Air with M2 chip, again in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes. This older model is cheaper than the M3 version, and while the hardware isn't quite as cutting edge, the M2 remains an excellent performer for day-to-day tasks. It also features the same design and screen as the newer model, so you're not making too many compromises if you want the cheapest MacBook out there.</p><p>Apple has also made a tweak to the base models of both the M2 and M3 versions, and they now come with 16GB of unified memory rather than 8GB - so you get a hefty upgrade for the same price.</p><p>Some retailers may still sell the 8GB models, and as they try to clear stock we've seen some big price cuts for these versions. I'd still recommend getting the 16GB model if your budget stretches to it, as those models will be more future-proof. But for the absolute lowest price for a MacBook Air, the 8GB model could be a real winner during Black Friday.</p>
