<p>The Black Friday PS5 deals are here and they are even bringing with them bona fide PS5 Pro discounts, as well as a host of sales and price cuts on complementing games and accessories.</p><p>I've been tracking gaming hardware and PlayStation deals, writing about gaming tech for years, and covering sales periods for years now. That includes covering the PS5 stock shortage of a few years ago, as well as covering record-low prices on a host of the best and our favorite gaming tech across the years. As a result, I know how to find the best deals, and what the best deals look like on all things PlayStation.</p><p>â€¢ See all of today's best deals at Amazon</p><p>The Black Friday PS5 deals are always a staple of the November sales period and represent the best time to invest in hardware and accessory upgrades as well as pick up the latest and greatest games going too. This year, we've got the introduction of the PS5 Pro to contend with too, and I'm hoping for some value-busting bundles on that machine that will include the disc drive and vertical stand at a reduced retail price - or, at the very least, a restock to make it easier to buy a PS5 disc drive.</p><p>Will we see 30th Anniversary stock? Unlikely on the whole, but we have seen some PS5 bundles throwing in the 30th Anniversary DualSense today which is at least something.</p><p>Away from that new console, be it PS5 Slim bundles, or discounts on the best PS5 headsets, controllers, storage solutions, or PS5 and PS5 Pro-enhanced games, I'm here to guide you through the swathes of deals and discounts we'll across the whole Black Friday period. And we'll start with a few of my top picks.</p>

<p>The big day is here! Black Friday has finally arrived and there's going to be so many deals and discounts to sift through and peruse!</p><p>It's the biggest shopping day of the year and there's so much PS5 hardware and games to save on. I'm back to help you find what you need among this year's Black Friday PS5 deals and PS5 Pro discounts.</p>

<p>There's almost no better place to start our coverage than the best prices on Sony's latest console, the PS5 Pro. Admittedly, though, this one is more exciting for our UK readers.</p><p>Our pick is the discount at EE, and for two reasons. First, it's a solid discount of 41 quid off the retail price of the console, but the shop is also offering an attractive trade-in offer that could see you bag up to Â£260 for your old console (a trade-in value that's then boosted by a code emailed to you).</p><p>This would take your cash outlay on a new PS5 Pro down to Â£399 which is pretty attractive if you were thinking of upgrading and definitely cements this as the best route to maximizing the value of a PS5 Pro in the UK.</p><p>Readers in the US have a much more limited scope for value right now, sadly. However, as long as Walmart continues to ignore the 99 cents of the list price, then that's the place to get your Pro from stateside.</p><p><strong>US - PS5 Pro:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/PLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE/11839818124"><strong>$699 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p><strong>UK - PS5 Pro</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-playstation-5-pro-1000046525-HW84.html" target="_blank">was <del>Â£699.99</del> now <strong>Â£659.99</strong> <strong>at</strong> <strong>EE</strong></a></p>

<p>Actually, maybe an <em>even</em> better starting point would be the best PS5 Slim prices we've seen in ages - nay, ever!</p><p>These prices are for the console only but represent the lowest-ever prices and thus the best-ever time to jump into this generation of PlayStation gaming.</p><p>As a PlayStation expert and somewhat fanboy, let me tell you that it is so worth it and these are brilliant prices to jump in on.</p><p><strong>US - PS5 Slim</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PlayStation-5-PS5-Disc-Console-Slim/5113183756?classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1800&from=/search">was <del>$499.99</del> now <strong>$424 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p><strong>US - PS5 Slim Digital Edition: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-PlayStation-5-PS5-Digital-Console-Slim/5113183757">was <del>$449.99</del> now<strong> $374 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p><strong>UK - PS5 Slim</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Playstation-711719577157-PlayStation-Console-Slim/dp/B0CM9VHGY7/" target="_blank">was <del>Â£479.99</del> now <strong>Â£399 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>UK - PS5 Digital Edition:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-5-Digital-Console-Slim/dp/B0CM9VKQ5N/" target="_blank">was <del>Â£389.99</del> now <strong>Â£309 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>Now on to the video games! There are plenty of offers to get your hands on this Black Friday but this is a cracker.</p><p><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, a personal favorite of mine from last year, and one of the best action-adventure games on the PS5. This US offer has been cut down to below half price, saving you $39 total, and the UK price is now distinctly impulse-purchase worthy...</p><p><strong>US - Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Star-Wars-Jedi-Survivor-PlayStation-5/1515791379" target="_blank">was <del>$69.99</del> now <strong>$30 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p><strong>UK - Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Electronic-Arts-216372-Star-Wars/dp/B0BLZVFJM1/">was <del>Â£28.95</del> now<strong> Â£24.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>And if you're planning on stocking up on said games this Black Friday, then you might well be in need of some extra storage. Lucky for you, I've found an excellent deal for one of the best SSDs for external use.</p><p>The Seagate Game Drive for PS5<strong> </strong>offers 5TB of storage, which is plenty of space for anyone, and perfect if you're taking a big library of PS4 games with you onto the Pro.</p><p><strong>US - Seagate Game Drive for PS5 5TB External USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Seagate-Game-Drive-for-PS5-5TB-External-USB-3-0-Portable-Hard-Drive-Officially-Licensed-STLV5000301/1824969876" target="_blank">was <del>$169.99</del> now <strong>$124 at Walmart</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UK - Seagate Game Drive for PS5 5TB External USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seagate-External-Officially-Licensed-STLV5000202/dp/B0CQD377LS/" target="_blank">was <del>Â£132.93</del> now <strong>Â£112.59 at Amazon</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Moving to PS5 accessories, this next deal may give you cause to skip Sony's fancy DualSense Edge as another PS5 "pro" controller is now 25% off at Amazon in the US, and heavily discounted in the UK too.</p><p>While a bit more on the expensive side, even with the price cut, I think it's totally worth it for the standout features alone. This controller is officially licensed for PlayStation gaming, as well as PC, and boasts trigger stops, mappable buttons, Bluetooth audio, and more.</p><p><strong>US - NACON Revolution 5 Pro Wireless Gaming Controller</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Officially-Licensed-PlayStation-Controller-5/dp/B0CLBLFDBL/?th=1" target="_blank">was <del>$199.99</del> now <strong>$149.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>UK - NACON Revolution 5 Pro Wireless Gaming Controller</strong>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3375691" target="_blank">was <del>$199.99</del> now <strong>Â£159.99 at Argos</strong></a></p>

<p>As folks finish work in the UK, it's a good time to remind you guys of some cracking DualSense deals currently running at EE. Among almost the whole range of DualSense controller discounts the retailer has got running, the best are on some of the very newest Chroma colorways - where you can save a whopping 26 quid!</p><p><strong>PS5 DualSense Chroma Pearl: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-ps5-dualsense---pearl-1000044424-HX8M.html">was <del>Â£69.99</del> now<strong> Â£43.99 at EE</strong></a><strong><br>PS5 DualSense Chroma Indigo: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.ee.co.uk/products/sony-ps5-dualsense---indigo-1000044475-HX8P.html">was <del>Â£69.99</del> now<strong> Â£43.99 at EE</strong></a></p>

<p>Hold up, I've just remembered another UK PS5 deal has come across my desk which I cannot let slide! The even better news is that there's also one running in the US which is superb news.</p><p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 is one of the best headsets I've tested in recent years and probably my top headset of 2024.
