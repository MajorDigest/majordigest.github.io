<p>In many ways, networking is a mature, stable industry, based on established technologies like Wi-Fi and Ethernet, which just celebrated its 50th anniversary. But networking vendors are constantly innovating to keep pace with skyrocketing volumes of traffic that need to move securely and reliably across complex multicloud environments.</p>



<p>Many of the categories and terms in this year’s Best of Networking (BENNY) technology awards didn’t even exist a decade ago: secure access service edge (SASE), SD-WAN, networking as a service (NaaS), and network detection and response (NDR).</p>



<p>Then there’s the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)—AI and generative AI have created exponentially greater demands on networks to move large data sets. On the flip side, networking vendors are incorporating AI and machine learning into their toolsets to analyze vast amounts of telemetry data and provide actionable intelligence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="award-categories">Award categories</h3>



<p>The categories in this year’s BENNY Awards reflect the rapidly evolving nature of networking:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Network performance management</li>



<li>Network automation</li>



<li> SD-WAN, SASE</li>



<li> Network visibility and observability</li>



<li> Automated backup and recovery</li>



<li> SDN/NaaS</li>



<li> Cloud/edge solutions</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-of-the-rest">Best of the Rest</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="winner-accelsius-neucool">Winner: Accelsius NeuCool</h3>



<p>As AI adoption grows, data centers are adding more GPUs to meet the growing demand for AI workloads. However, many data centers are unprepared to handle the heat surge released by AI processors, as traditional air cooling cannot efficiently cool the servers. Accelsius’ NeuCool two-phase, direct-to-chip cooling system addresses these challenges. With NeuCool, highly engineered vaporators (also known as cold plates) are mounted directly to targeted hot-spot chips. The solution then directs an ecofriendly, safe, dielectric refrigerant through the vaporators. The cooling process turns the liquid refrigerant into vapor, which then travels through an industrial manifold, condensing back into a liquid in a closed-loop system.</p>



<p>The NeuCool architecture is driven by the iPCU, a highly engineered cooling distribution unit, with enterprisegrade redundancies, industrial components, and extensive safety testing to maximize uptime. NeuCool’s modular design enables seamless integration into existing data center facilities via water-cooled doors, dry coolers, or other heat rejection methods.</p>



<p><strong>From the judge</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Data center operators need to be prepared to accommodate AI workloads, which run on heat-generating GPU chips, while keeping cooling and electricity costs under control. Accelsius’ NeuCool two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling technology enables energy savings of up to 50% compared to air cooling and requires zero water consumption.</p>

<p>Extreme’s portfolio of Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 solutions enable customers to embrace 6 GHz, known as the next era of wireless connectivity. This spectrum creates a new superhighway for connectivity, allowing organizations of all sizes and industries to access dedicated connections for Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 devices. It provides faster data speeds, increased capacity, reduced interference, and improved latency.</p>



<p>The newest generation, Wi-Fi 7, adds features including 320 MHz channels and multi-link operation (MLO). This increases bandwidth with additional channels and allows simultaneous usage of multiple bands and channels to maintain the best possible connection—in turn enabling more efficient and reliable wireless connectivity. The Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 solutions from Extreme are backward-compatible to support all currently deployed connected devices. Once APs are set up, management is incredibly simple, and customers can take advantage of AIOps management.</p>
