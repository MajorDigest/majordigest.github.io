<p>Software-defined wide-area networks (SD-WAN) is sofware that can manage and enforce the routing of WAN traffic to the appropriate wide-area connection based on policies that can take into consideration factors including cost, link performance, time of day, and application needs based on policies. Like its bigger technology brother, software-defined networking, SD-WAN decouples the control plane from the data plane. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>VPN</strong></h3>



<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) can create secure remote-access and site-to-site connections inexpensively, can be an option in SD-WANs, and are proving useful in IoT.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></h3>



<p>Wi-Fi refers to the wireless LAN technologies that utilize the IEEE 802.11 standards for communications. Wi-Fi products use radio waves to transmit data to and from devices with Wi-Fi software clients to access points that route the data to the connected wired network..</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>802.11ad</strong></h3>



<p>802.11ad is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard, developed to provide a multiple gigabit wireless system standard at 60 GHz frequency, and is a networking standard for WiGig networks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>802.11ay</strong></h3>



<p>802.11ay is a proposed enhancement to the current (2021) technical standards for Wi-Fi. It is the follow-up to IEEE 802.11ad, quadrupling the bandwidth and adding MIMO up to 8 streams. It will be the second WiGig standard.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)</strong></h3>



<p>802.11ax, officially marketed by the Wi-Fi Alliance as Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, is an IEEE standard for wireless local-area networks and the successor of 802.11ac. It is also known as High Efficiency Wi-Fi, for the overall improvements to Wi-Fi 6 clients under dense environments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wi-Fi 6E</strong></h3>



<p>Wi-Fi 6E is an extension of Wi-Fi 6 unlicensed wireless technology operating in the 6GHz band, and it provides lower latency and faster data rates than Wi-Fi 6. The spectrum also has a shorter range and supports more channels than bands that were already dedicated to Wi-Fi, making it suitable for deployment in high-density areas like stadiums.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beamforming</strong></h3>



<p>Beamforming is a technique that focuses a wireless signal towards a specific receiving device, rather than having the signal spread in all directions from a broadcast antenna, as it normally would. The resulting more direct connection is faster and more reliable than it would be without beamforming.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Controllerless Wi-Fi</strong></h3>



<p>It’s no longer necessary for enterprises to install dedicated Wi-Fi controllers in their data centers because that function can be distributed among access points or moved to the cloud, but it’s not for everybody.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MU-MIMO</strong></h3>



<p>MU-MIMO stands for multi-user, multiple input, multiple output, and is wireless technology supported by routers and endpoint devices. MU-MIMO is the next evolution from single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), which is generally referred to as MIMO. MIMO technology was created to help increase the number of simultaneous users a singel access point can support, which was initially achieved by increasing the number of antennas on a wireless router.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>OFDMA</strong></h3>



<p>Orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) provides Wi-Fi 6 with high throughput and more network efficiency by letting multiple clients connect to a single access point simultaneously.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)</strong></h3>



<p>802.11ax, officially marketed by the Wi-Fi Alliance as Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, is an IEEE standard for wireless local-area networks and the successor of 802.11ac. It is also known as High Efficiency Wi-Fi, for the overall improvements to Wi-Fi 6 clients under dense environments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wi-Fi standards and speeds</strong></h3>



<p>Ever-improving Wi-Fi standards make for denser, faster Wi-Fi networks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WPA3</strong></h3>



<p>The WPA3 Wi-Fi security standard tackles WPA2 shortcomings to better secure personal, enterprise, and IoT wireless networks.</p>
