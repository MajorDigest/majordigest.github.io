<p>As we head into 2025, businesses are dialed in on hiring roles such as software engineer, software developer, and end-user support, as well roles centered around cloud, database management, and systems engineering and administration, according to Robert Half Technology’s 2025 IT salary report.</p>



<p>With so much disruption in the tech industry in the past year, most notably the continuing rise of AI in the enterprise, executive priorities are shifting, with a growing focus on hiring for the future. But with only 35% of professionals actively searching for a job, compared to 49% last year, according to Robert Half, it’s little wonder why 90% of IT hiring managers report challenges finding the talent they need in today’s market.</p>



<p>As a result, more technology managers (60%) are turning to contract professionals to meet skills needs. This is especially true for roles involving AI and machine learning; security, privacy, and compliance; and software and applications development.</p>



<p>For organizations looking to attract talent, job seekers are interested in competitive compensation, career and professional development, and a commitment to healthy work life balance. Expect heavy competition for software engineers, software developers, and cloud, database, and systems engineers and administrators, as well as end-user support professionals. </p>



<p>Here are 10 jobs expected to be in high demand for 2025, the skills and experience you should look for when hiring, and the salary ranges you’ll want to pay to stay competitive in the marketplace — ranked by average pay.</p>
