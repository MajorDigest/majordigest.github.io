These innovative earbuds use clinical-grade EEG technology to precisely assess sleep stages and depth, providing unprecedented insights into a user's nocturnal experience. </p><p>When the Tone Buds detect stage N3 sleep, the deepest stage of non-rapid eye movement sleep, they emit subtle pink noise stimulation to enhance rest. The AI-powered, closed-loop audio system responds dynamically to the user's brain waves, providing comforting audio for falling asleep and sound-neutralizing tracks to help users stay asleep. </p><p>With sleep disorders affecting approximately 70 million Americans and poor sleep linked to serious health risks like heart disease, stroke and cognitive decline, the Tone Buds represent a significant advancement in personal sleep technology.
