<p>Navigating the corporate world is challenging enough, but it can be especially difficult for autistic adults. According to the Autism Society, there are 5.4 million autistic adults in the US and among those with a college degree, up to 85% are either unemployed or underemployed. Additionally, autistic adults on average earn 40% less than their peers with other disabilities, and only 30% on average say they disclose they’re autistic to their employer, according to data from auticon, a leading employer of autistic adults in technology and provider of neuroinclusion services.</p>



<p>That’s why auticon started the Auticon Training Institute (ATI), a US nonprofit offering structured IT and tech training pathways, certifications, internships, mentorships, and networking opportunities free of charge for autistic adults, empowering them to start careers in software engineering, data analysis, cybersecurity, and more. In partnership with auticon, they also offer extensive training for organizations to become more neuroinclusive, creating welcoming environments for neurodiverse talent.</p>



<p>A large majority of autistic people, around 85%, report they enjoy the work they do, however only 44% say they feel they can be their authentic selves at work. This leads to burnout and adds unnecessary burdens to neurodiverse workers, often leading them to struggle to sustain their careers. But there are steps organizations can take to create a more welcoming environment for neurodivergent workers, and understand what makes them thrive at work so they can reveal their full potential.</p>



<p>One of the missions of auticon is to help people who have been on the sidelines of tech while helping organizations become more neuroinclusive, says Vance Checketts, CEO of auticon US and ATI board president.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strength-in-partnership">Strength in partnership</h3>



<p>The first cohort of ATI trainees embarked on internships at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in 2021, where Bob McCowan, SVP and CIO, welcomed them onto technical and IT teams. As one of the first partners of ATI, the biotechnology company hired interns to form a team of data stewards to work on a significant data segmentation project. The interns were specifically responsible to verify the accuracy and reliability of data, working alongside the team to ensure they adhere to compliance and regulatory policies.</p>

<p>McCowan says he understands following a non-traditional path into technology. Growing up in Ireland, he left school at 16 to become an apprentice to an electrician, later going back to school as an adult to get his master’s degree, and eventually moving into the biotechnology industry. He grasps the value that a less conventional background can bring to a technology team, which is why he was eager to partner with auticon to create opportunities for autistic technology professionals, and open a diverse talent pipeline.</p>



<p>“People stick to the safe bets,” he says. “They go to the same colleges, they hire people that look the same, and it takes a bit of extra effort to go a different direction. But the reward of making that effort is a more diverse organization with a broader range of thought, which strengthens business results.”</p>



<p>After learning about auticon and ATI, McGowan saw the organizations as a unique opportunity to expand and grow his talent pipeline, and move away from hiring from the same small pool of talent as the rest of the industry.</p>



<p>The programs through ATI are customized to the companies they partner with, offering free technical training that aligns with the organizations’ skills needs. The technical training is free for autistic adults, but the interns are also paid through the organizations, making it a more accessible opportunity for those who rely on an income.</p>



<p>“Senior executives recognize the tie between diversity and innovation,” says Checketts. “If you’re trying to innovate or come up with a solution to a big problem, having a bunch of brains that think differently is a recipe for success.”</p>



<p>auticon also offers resources to help foster neuroinclusive environments, including a Neuroinclusion Maturity Assessment to help organizations identify where they currently stand, how they can improve, and where they have gaps in their processes or culture. Additionally, organizations can take advantage of bespoke advisory services to implement internal neurodiversity programs.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">auticon</p></div>



<p>Organizations can also work with auticon to internally offer continuing professional development (CPD) programs to address any gaps in understanding neurodivergence, and to break down barriers to support talent who are unaware they’re neurodivergent or choose not to disclose.</p>



<p>One of the secrets to ATI’s success is having job coaches readily available to help trainees navigate any unfamiliar scenarios that might arise at work. Checketts says trainees have expressed concerns about what to wear on Zoom calls, understanding office lingo, and what to expect when they’re invited to work events, meetings, or coffee chats.</p>



<p>Office environments can have many unspoken rules and nuanced social conventions that aren’t directly expressed, especially to new workers. Job coaches help the trainees understand how to prepare for these situations, especially in cases where it’s something they might not feel comfortable asking new coworkers or managers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-program-works">How the program works</h3>



<p>Jordan White, an intern through the auticon Training Institute currently works as a data steward for Regeneron. Prior to joining the ATI program, White worked as a freelancer, giving him the flexibility to work from home — a perk that can greatly benefit neurodiverse workers. He also has extensive experience as a software engineer and front-end developer with different organizations.</p>



<p>He says that while many companies haven’t learned how to manage autistic professionals yet, ATI offers the support he needs, while also trains managers on how to support autistic employees. Prior to starting his internship, White’s job coach met with his internship manager to share what supports are best for him in the workplace. He says this helped his internship manager explain his work to him in a way that wasn’t vague or ambiguous, another key to working with autistic adults.</p>



<p>That’s an important aspect of any DEI conversation — that you’re not only recruiting diverse employees, but also fostering environments where everyone feels welcome and supported. Retention is key to diversity, and if you don’t do the work internally, your organization may struggle to hang on to diverse workers who feel alienated or isolated at their jobs.</p>



<p>White says the ATI program has expanded his knowledge areas, especially around data tech frameworks and AI governance, and attributes the job coaching program for strengthening his communication and time management skills.</p>



<p>“Neurodivergent or autistic people can have large struggles in the workplace because of the way we think or act,” says White. “And many times, people tend to think we can’t hit the ground running or we don’t have the ability to rise up to the challenge. This is why ATI is a perfect choice, because they’ll support you at every step to improve your career while you do your best work.”</p>



<p>Brian Rodewald, another ATI trainee and intern with Regeneron, also attributes the program to expanding his network by connecting him with other autistic professionals in the industry. He also got to expand his own boundaries by building on his foundational knowledge of computer programming with computer network security skills.</p>



<p>Rodewald has a history with tech, going back to AP computer science courses in high school, learning Java as a way to cope with experiencing back-to-back storms that hit his regional area during that time, noting that a childhood interest in weather has lent to his adulthood interest in computer security. Through auticon, Rodewald says he’s had the opportunity to network with other neurodivergent professionals, and gain skills in areas such as cybersecurity and gen AI.</p>



<p>“I got to expand my own boundaries by taking what I already understood about computer programming, and pivot over to a slightly different and slightly daunting field — computer network security,” he says. “I get the opportunity not just to learn more about cybersecurity and computer science, but also listen to other neurodivergent people and share what we’ve all learned.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="management-training-and-internal-shifts">Management training and internal shifts</h3>



<p>One aspect of managing autistic professionals that McCowan’s team found beneficial is they have a tendency to be very straightforward. For instance, McCowan says that a leader of a cybersecurity team told him one of the interns pointed out McCowan wasn’t explicit enough in defining what tasks he asked them to do or what the expected outcomes were.</p>



<p>After processing the feedback, the leader realized the intern was right, and he wondered if others on the team felt the same way. It led him to grow as a leader, encouraging others to speak up about ways to improve the way they got their work done.</p>



<p>And the data backs it up with organizations that partner with auticon expressing mostly positive results. In a report from auticon, 96% of respondents say that auticon consultants made valuable contributions to their projects, citing greater accuracy, alternative perspectives and ideas, innovative approaches, and increased efficiency. Additionally, 73% report a positive cultural impact on their team through clearer communication, better teamwork, increased empathy, and a greater sense of purpose.</p>



<p>It’s not only about setting up autistic professionals to adapt to a work environment, it’s also about accommodating other communication styles. Training can help autistic professionals feel prepared for corporate environments, while organizations shift traditional mindsets to better accommodate neurodiverse workers.</p>



<p>For instance, McCowan says he’s had ATI trainees who’ve pointed out when he or others make distracting noises in meetings. “It’s likely others are bothered by the sounds, but don’t feel confident in speaking up about it,” he says. Adjustments like these, he adds, can improve team morale, promote open communication, and encourage everyone to grow.</p>



<p>“That’s the growth from diversity you’re bringing in — new voices, different people, and everyone has to make those shifts,” he says. “More voices just strengthen organizations, as long as everyone’s willing to make those shifts and accommodations.  That just seems good for any company or organization.”</p>
