<p>Despite diversity being a much-discussed topic in the tech industry, representation for Black tech workers is still not where it needs to be, with African Americans holding just 7% of the positions and only 2% of tech executive roles, according to data from the 2022 Diversity in High Tech report published by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>



<p>Moreover, Black IT pros, even those in leadership positions, still encounter unique challenges both in the workplace and in their career paths. And maintaining a conversation around the importance of diversity is more crucial than ever, with the recent Trump administration implementing sweeping anti-DEI executive orders, laying off all federal DEI workers.</p>



<p>It becomes increasingly important to address as we’ve seen major tech organizations such as Amazon and Meta quietly roll back and eliminate internal DEI programs and initiatives, which shows a jarring pivot since, just a couple of years ago, these same companies publicly claimed they were at the forefront of DEI, leading the way to champion and bolster tech diversity. However, such programs barely had time to get off the ground in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement before being brought to a screeching halt in 2025.</p>



<p>While the onus of change rests in large part on employers to alter their approaches to hiring and fostering inclusivity in the workplace, the following 16 professional organizations are dedicated to advancing the careers of Black IT pros, and increasing Black representation in the tech industry at all levels through training, networking resources, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="american-association-of-blacks-in-energy">American Association of Blacks in Energy</h3>



<p>The American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) ensures African Americans and other minorities have input and a voice in the discussion and development of energy policies, regulations, R&amp;D technologies, and environmental issues. AABE annually awards $350,000 in scholarships to students in energy-related tech fields, and offers a career center for job seekers and employers. There’s also the AABE Institute, which provides training, technical assistance, market information, supplier and partnership opportunities, and business solutions. The AABE Institute’s goal is to be a leading resource for energy issues in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Diaspora, with a focus on sustainable development.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="black-code-collective">Black Code Collective</h3>



<p>The Black Code Collective (BCC) was started in 2016 to create a safe space and community for Black software engineers. Many Black technologists find themselves to be one of the only Black employees on their team or in the room. And according to BCC, workspaces are often started and run by white people, which brings an unspoken burden for Black people. This inherent bias, which runs through the industry, is what makes groups like BCC so important. It gives Black technologists a space to connect with peers who understand their situation, and who can help ease some of the stress that can come from navigating predominantly white workspaces. BCC advocates for taking the necessary steps to retool the IT and tech talent pipelines, and how to take the right steps to ensure Black tech workers have the same opportunity, sponsorship, and equity as their non-BIPOC peers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="black-data-processing-associates">Black Data Processing Associates</h3>



<p>Founded in 1975, the Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA) is an international organization that serves as a network for underrepresented minorities working in the IT and computer science fields. The BDPA organizes technology conferences, local chapter events, continuing education and professional development events, academic scholarships, and mentoring and career opportunities for Black IT professionals. The BPDA also organizes community outreach programs for students, including the Student Information Technology Education and Scholarship (SITES), National High School Computer Competitions (HSCC), and Youth Technology Camp (YTC) to increase representation in tech and create pipelines for future talent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="black-tech-nation-btn">Black Tech Nation (BTN)</h3>



<p>Black Tech Nation (BTN) helps Black technologists gain access to valuable resources, networks, and opportunities in the tech industry. It was started in 2017 after its founder, Kelauni Jasmyn, noticed that after graduating a coding bootcamp, she didn’t see many other software developers who looked like her in the local tech scene. She later received a grant to create BTN as  a community for other Black technologists who also felt isolated in their careers. The organization offers companies a pipeline to Black tech talent, supports the next generation of Black tech entrepreneurs, highlights impactful Black techies, and helps create community hubs in cities for Black technologists to connect, network, and find support.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="black-tech-pipeline">Black Tech Pipeline</h3>



<p>Black Tech Pipeline started with a viral tweet. The organization’s founder, Pariss Chandler, asked followers “What does Black Twitter in Tech look like?” and the response was overwhelming, according to an article from TechCrunch. Not long after, Chandler was contacted by companies looking to recruit Black tech workers, and although she had never worked in recruiting before, she quickly developed a talent database and connected candidates with potential employers. Launching the Black Tech Pipeline in 2020, Chandler partners with companies and offers various services to help connect them with Black technologists looking for new jobs. But she soon recognized the tech industry also has a retention problem, especially with Black tech workers, so she expanded her services to include a consulting package, conducting biweekly check-ins during the first 90 days to see how new Black Tech Pipeline hires are doing at their new jobs. The goal is to prove there isn’t a pipeline problem — that there are plenty of skilled and experienced Black technologists available who are eager to work at every level for equitable and diverse organizations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="blacks-in-technology">Blacks in Technology</h3>



<p>Black workers in the tech industry typically experience underrepresentation, which bleeds into career growth, pay equity, and mentorship opportunities. Non-profit organization Blacks in Technology (BIT) aims to “stomp the divide” Black workers face in the IT industry to help level the playing field through training, education, networking and mentorship with the support of allies, partners and sponsors, according to the organization. BIT has chapters across the US and internationally where members can attend events, trainings, and tech summits designed to uplift and connect the Black tech community. Members also get access to career support, networking, and tech resources. Membership is open to any Black woman or man who works in tech, making it the largest community of BIPOC tech workers in the world. Read here for more on Blacks in Technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="blacks-united-in-leading-technology-built">Blacks United in Leading Technology (BUiLT)</h3>



<p>Blacks United in Leading Technology (BUiLT) is a non-profit professional organization that offers community-focused activities, events, and programs that focus on Black technology workers and highlight the importance of diversity, equity, and equality in the tech industry. BUiLT believes in “equity for Blacks in tech, in where they work, with those who buy our products, and investors who support our ventures,” according to the website. You can find BUiLT chapters across the US, with locations in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Miami, North Texas, San Diego, and more. Members enjoy free and discounted technical training, including discounted rates for Lean Six Sigma certifications, along with free training for the cybersecurity PenTest+ certification. Members also get access to a large network of other entrepreneurs, founders, senior business leaders, and other professionals dedicated to increasing representation of Black people in technology. Membership also includes professional development courses, mentorship opportunities, events, speaking opportunities, engagement with corporate sponsors, private events, and optional website listings for business owners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="black-professionals-in-tech-network-bptn">Black Professionals in Tech Network (BPTN)</h3>



<p>The Black Professionals in Tech Network (BPTN) was started as a way for Black tech professionals to connect with one another to build communities. Its network currently consists of more than 50,000 Black professionals who network, connect, share resources, and grow their careers together. Members get access to mentorship, events, summits, skill-building opportunities, and a strong peer network to support career growth. The goal of BPTN is not only to connect Black tech professionals, but help corporations strengthen diversity in the talent pipeline. BPTN also helps corporate partners understand how to attract, hire, retain, and promote Black tech talent by changing the way they hire and their internal culture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code2040">CODE2040</h3>



<p>CODE2040 is a non-profit that connects and mobilizes the largest racial equity community in tech to dismantle structural barriers that prevent the full participation and leadership of Black and Latinx technologists in the innovation economy, according to the organization. It achieves this through events, training, early-career programs, and knowledge sharing to ensure Black and Latinx technologists have the tools and network to enable racial equity throughout the tech industry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="devcolor">DevColor</h3>



<p>DevColor bills itself as a global career accelerator for Black software engineers, technologists, and executives, and serves as the go-to accountability partner for the companies who invest in, employ, and are led by them. DevColor is dedicated to creating a community for Black leaders in IT, by offering career development and networking resources. They offer several unique programs, including the A* program that matches participants with a small cohort of six to eight Black software engineers and managers for a year to build accountability, career mapping, and community. For a spotlight on DevColor, read more here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="digitalundivided-did">DigitalUndivided (DID)</h3>



<p>DigitalUndivided (DID) is an organization focused on fostering more inclusivity in entrepreneurship for Black and Latinx women. It started as a conference for Black women founders in tech, which led to it growing into a focus fellow (FF) program, and eventually it turned into an eight-week virtual accelerator program. DID didn’t stop there. It later took on research projects that uncovered how Black and Latinx female founders receive less than 0.2% of all venture funding. After the report was released, the number of startups led by Black women tripled and funding increased 500%. DID has since continued to expand its offering of programs, initiatives, and research to uplift Black and Latinx female founders in tech.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="information-technology-senior-management-forum-itsmf">Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF)</h3>



<p>The Information Technology Senior Management Forum (ITSMF) offers career-advancing programs for Black IT professionals. The ITSMF was formed in 1996 by a group of technology executives who wanted to improve diversity in the technology industry all the way to the executive level. The mission of the ITSMF is to increase representation of Black professionals at senior levels in tech, and to impact organizational innovation and growth. The ITSMF offers programs for executives, managers, and an “emerge” program specifically designed to increase representation of women of color at senior levels in the tech industry. For a spotlight on ITSMF, read more here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="national-action-council-for-minorities-in-engineering-nacme">National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME)</h3>



<p>The National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) is a professional organization for underrepresented minorities working in engineering and STEM roles, and  provides college scholarships for those interested in pursuing a degree in STEM. The goal is to increase representation of BIPOC in tech by providing scholarships, resources, and opportunities for high-achieving, underrepresented minority college students pursuing careers in engineering and computer science, it affirms. NACME’s focus is on helping students become qualified candidates for in-demand tech jobs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="national-society-of-black-engineers-nsbe">National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)</h3>

The mission of the NSBE is “to increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community,” according to the organization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="technologists-of-color">Technologists of Color</h3>



<p>Technologists of Color was established in 2012, and its goal is to build a community of Black tech workers in Atlanta, Georgia, while also offering various services and programs to its members. The organization offers meetups, happy hours, and conferences for members, as well as coding programs and resources to equip members with laptops and other necessary equipment. The organization has held several types of events, including coding workshops, meet-up events for members to build their networks, app showcase events, and coding events for youths in the community.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we-build-black">We Build Black</h3>



<p>Non-profit We Build Black was founded in 2017 by Devin Jackson, who was feeling isolated as the only Black software engineer in his company. Unable to find an established community to connect with other Black developers, Jackson decided to take matters into his own hands by starting the Black Software Engineers of NYC Meetup. The event was hosted every Saturday afternoon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, eventually growing to 1,000 members within six months. From there, Jackson and his fellow Black software engineers knew they had something special and wanted to grow the group into a full-blown organization. We Build Black also hosts the Mavens I/O: Black Women in Tech conference each year, and brings coding programs to schools, pilots a recidivism awareness program, and works to connect members to new job opportunities.</p>
