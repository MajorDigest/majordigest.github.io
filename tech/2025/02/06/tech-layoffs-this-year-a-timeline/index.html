<p>2025 began in turmoil, with layoffs at some of the largest tech companies despite the support shown by the new US administration. 2024 had been a year of recovery, with the pace of layoffs slowing and IT employment the highest for years following two years of massive IT layoff in 2022 and 2023.</p>



<p>According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. In 2025, it has already logged 7,003 staff laid off by 31 companies.</p>



<p>Here is a list — to be updated regularly — of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tech-layoffs-in-2025">Tech layoffs in 2025</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Workday</li>



<li>Salesforce</li>



<li>Meta</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Feb. 5, 2025: Workday lays off 1,750</h3>



<p>As it moves to invest more in AI and international growth, Workday is laying off 8.5% of its workforce and disposing of unused office space. Some analysts fear the cutbacks will affect the company’s customer service — unless AI can pick up the slack.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="feb-4-2025-salesforce-lays-off-over-1000">Feb. 4, 2025: Salesforce lays off over 1,000</h3>



<p>At the same time as it’s hiring sales staff for its new artificial intelligence products, Salesforce is laying off over 1,000 workers across the company, according to Bloomberg. As of June, 2024, the company had over 72,000 employees, according to its website. Salesforce did not comment on the report. In 2024 the company reportedly laid off around 1,000 staff too, in two waves: January and July.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jan-14-2025-meta-will-lay-off-5-of-workforce">Jan. 14, 2025: Meta will lay off 5% of workforce</h3>



<p>Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees he intended to “move out the low performers faster” in an internal memo reported by Bloomberg. The memo announced that the company will lay off 5% of its staff, or around 3,600 staff, beginning Feb. 10. The company had already reduced its headcount by 5% in 2024 through natural attrition, the memo said. Among those leaving the company will be staff previously responsible for fact checking of posts on its social media platforms in the US, as the company begins relying on its users to police content.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tech-layoffs-in-2024">Tech layoffs in 2024</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Equinix</li>



<li>AMD</li>



<li>Freshworks</li>



<li>Cisco</li>



<li>General Motors</li>



<li>Intel</li>



<li>OpenText</li>



<li>Microsoft</li>



<li>AWS</li>



<li>Dell</li>



<li>Cisco</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nov. 26, 2024: Equinix to cut 3% of staff</h3>



<p>Despite intense demand for its data center capacity, Equinix is planning to lay off 3% of its workforce, or around 400 employees. The announcement followed the appointment of Adaire Fox-Martin to replace Charles Meyers as CEO and the departures of two other senior executives, CIO Milind Wagle and CISO Michael Montoya.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nov. 13, 2024: AMD to cut 4% of workforce</h3>



<p>AMD will lay off around 1,000 employees as it pivots towards developing AI-focused chips, it said. The move came as a surprise to staff, as the company also reported strong quarterly earnings. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nov. 7, 2024: Freshworks lays off 660</h3>



<p>Enterprise software vendor Freshworks laid off around 660 staff, or around 13% of its headcount, despite reporting increased revenue and profits in its fourth fiscal quarter. The company described the layoffs as a realignment of its global workforce.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sept. 17, 2024: Cisco lays off 6,000</h3>



<p>After laying off around 4,200 staff in February, Cisco is at it again, laying off another 6,000 or around 7% of its workforce. Among the divisions affected were its threat intelligence unit, Talos Security. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aug. 20, 2024: General Motors lays off 1,000 software staff</h3>



<p>More than 1,000 software and services staff are on the way out at General Motors, signalling that it could be rethinking its digital transformation strategy. In an internal memo, the company said that it was moving resources to its highest-priority work and flattening hierarchies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">August 1, 2024: Intel removes 15,000 roles</h3>



<p>Intel plans to cut its workforce by around 15% to reduce costs after a disastrous second quarter. Revenue for the three months to June 29 stagnated at around $12.8 billion, but net income fell 85% to $83 million, prompting CEO Pat Gelsinger to bring forward a company-wide meeting in order to announce that 15,000 staff would lose their jobs. “This is an incredibly hard day for Intel as we are making some of the most consequential changes in our company’s history,” Gelsinger wrote in an email to staff, continuing: “Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both — particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">July 4, 2024: OpenText to lay off 1,200</h3>



<p>OpenText said it will lay off 1,200 staff, or about 1.7% of its workforce, in a bid to save around $100 million annually. It plans to hire new sales and engineering staff in other areas in 2025, it said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">June 4, 2024: Microsoft lays off staff in Azure division</h3>



<p>Microsoft laid off staff in several teams supporting its cloud services, including Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering. The company didn’t say exactly how many staff were leaving.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">April 4, 2024: Amazon downsizes AWS in a fresh cost-cutting round</h3>



<p>Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs in the sales and marketing teams of its AWS cloud services division — and also in the technology development teams for its physical retail stores, as it stepped back from efforts to generalize the “Just Walk Out” technology built for its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">April 1, 2024: Dell acknowledges 13,000 job cuts</h3>



<p>Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Feb. 14, 2024: Cisco cuts 5% of workforce</h3>



<p>Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications. </p>
