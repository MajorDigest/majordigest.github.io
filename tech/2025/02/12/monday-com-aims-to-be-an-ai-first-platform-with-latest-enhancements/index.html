<p>Monday.com has accelerated its push into artificial intelligence (AI) with the announcement this week of its AI vision, which includes three areas of focus: AI Blocks, embedded Product Power-ups, and a forthcoming Digital Workforce of AI agents.</p>



<p>The new features, the company said in its announcement, “will give SMBs and mid-market companies a competitive advantage to scale and shift business dynamics without increasing resources, and enable enterprise and Fortune 500 companies to accelerate processes often slowed by scale.”</p>



<p>“Our ambition is to make monday.com an AI-first platform, where AI isn’t just an add-on but a core part of how businesses operate,” Or Fridman, AI product group lead, told Computerworld. “We believe AI has the potential to solve some of the most demanding business challenges, whether it’s making projects more predictable, improving decision-making, or automating complex workflows.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-blocks-in-action">AI Blocks in action</h3>



<p>With AI Blocks, available in Monday Pro and Enterprise plans, users can set up their Monday board to automatically use AI on their behalf. Actions are customizable to specific projects and support both new and existing workflows without the need for technical expertise.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t require any prompting knowledge, and in less than 30 seconds, customers can set up their first AI Block,” said Fridman. “Ease of use is a major differentiating factor for us. Our platform is built on building blocks, helping people use technology easily.”</p>



<p>Each AI Block wraps an AI capability with context from a user’s work data. Customers choose the input (emails, documents, board column data), identify what they want the AI to do, and dictate where the output should be located (in a document or on a board column). The AI can be instructed, for instance, to prioritize tasks, assign workers to projects, extract information, assign labels, translate and improve text, and summarize updates.</p>



<p>“Monday.com’s AI Blocks are designed to integrate AI capabilities into existing processes without causing a lot of disruption,” said Melody Brue, VP and principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “The goal is to make AI more accessible to users who may not have specialized technical knowledge.”</p>



<p>Some use cases for AI Blocks, the company said, include lead categorization and file extraction (such as in HR). </p>



<p>For example, a hiring manager could create a board to identify qualified candidates who should be moved on to the interview phase. She can add an AI-powered column with the task “assign labels,” which, based on her specific criteria, such as how many years of experience, skills and competencies a candidate must have, can automatically detect hireability. AI will then autofill columns with information from applicable candidate resumés, including email, phone number, and current employment, so that the recruiter can start making phone calls.</p>



<p>“AI Blocks provide the most help in aggregating information for reporting, reducing the time spent looking for relevant information, and then offering suggestions for the end user to communicate,” said Margo S. Visitacion, Forrester VP and principal analyst.</p>



<p>She emphasized, “users still need to verify the information is correct, but it can trim a lot of time from those tasks.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="product-power-ups-and-digital-workforce">Product Power-ups and Digital Workforce</h3>



<p>Along with AI Blocks, Monday’s portfolio now has AI-generated Product Power-ups embedded throughout, which can automatically, for instance, rank best skill matches for tasks and reassign them accordingly, or identify project issues that require attention, such as resource scheduling or conflicts that might be causing delays.</p>



<p>“Our AI can proactively surface risks in large projects, making them more predictable and manageable,” said Fridman.</p>



<p>Finally, Monday’s upcoming “Digital Workforce” is a group of autonomously-operating AI agents that can perform tasks for users. The company will roll out its first agent, a “monday expert,” in March. This agent is designed to assist with onboarding new users and provide guidance around Monday features. Other planned agents include “deal facilitator” and “service analyzer.”</p>



<p>Fridman explained that customers can choose the relevant digital worker from the Monday marketplace and interact with it through chat and other in-product experiences. “It’s important to us to give value as quickly as possible without a long onboarding experience,” he said, pointing out that the AI workers will quickly learn, and adjust to, user preferences.</p>



<p>For instance, in customer support, an “AI-first digital service worker” could automatically resolve tickets so that human agents can move onto something more complex.</p>



<p>“If they work the way they are intended, they’ll make automating repeatable activities an integrated part of how an information worker executes their day job,” said Forrester’s Visitacion, “which can cut down on duplication of activities, task switching or potentially incorrect aggregation.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="addressing-concerns-around-predictability-reliability-safety">Addressing concerns around predictability, reliability, safety</h3>



<p>All told, the potential for AI agents is “enormous” when it comes to worker productivity, said Visitacion. “Companies can ask more complex questions and get meatier answers to support decision-making or automate the right workflows,” she said.</p>



<p>But she emphasized: “To get there, however, companies really must focus on structuring data and ensuring security and trust to ensure reliability.”</p>



<p>That’s a big, overarching concern: Addressing AI predictability, reliability and safety. Fridman said that Monday’s AI features follow the same data residency standards that exist across its portfolio, including multi-region support and encryption to ensure the privacy and security of customer data.</p>



<p>Further, “we fine-tune and optimize each AI engine and AI Block using proprietary techniques to ensure high quality, accuracy and built-in safeguards.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, agents will enable businesses to operate at a “previously impossible level, regardless of size,” Fridman said. These new capabilities are a “game-changer,” he said, particularly for SMBs that often lack the resources to scale like their larger enterprise counterparts. For instance, instead of hiring additional staff, SMBs can ‘hire’ digital workers to complete time-consuming, repetitive tasks such as managing operations, automating client communications, or streamlining order fulfillment.</p>



<p>“This allows them to scale faster, serve more customers, and focus on growth, all without the overhead of expanding their teams too quickly,” said Fridman. He added: “Our mission is to democratize AI, making it accessible and impactful for every business, not just the big players.”</p>



<p>Fridman emphasized that in 2025 and beyond, Monday is doubling down on AI-driven automation and intelligence.</p>



<p>“We want businesses to use AI not just for small tasks, but to redefine how work gets done,” he said. “That means evolving our digital workforce to handle increasingly sophisticated workflows. Our vision is a future where any company can build, automate, and optimize their operations using AI without needing data scientists or complex setups.”</p>



<p>In its announcement, Monday said, “To ensure AI remains accessible, monday.com offers a flexible and transparent pricing model for AI Blocks. Every plan includes 500 free AI Credits per month, providing teams with a simple way to explore the power of AI. For organizations with more significant needs, additional credits are available through buckets that scale with usage. Options range from a starter pack of 2,500 credits, geared towards lower usage, to enterprise buckets of 250,000 credits, providing flexibility for businesses of all sizes.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-esm-now-ga">AI ESM now GA</h3>



<p>Monday also announced that its AI-first enterprise service management (ESM) platform is now generally available to all customers.</p>



<p>Just emerged from beta, the ESM offers AI-powered ticket resolution and automatic ticket classification and routing. It also features comprehensive service team dashboards intended to provide real-time insights into ticket trends, service performance and organization needs. Finally, a customizable customer portal allows users to access self-service options, submit tickets, track status, and communicate with the service team. </p>
