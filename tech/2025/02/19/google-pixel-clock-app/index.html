<p>Google’s Pixel phones are practically overflowing with useful stuff. And some of the best options of all are things you’ve probably never even noticed.</p>



<p>That’s true for the Pixel’s core Android software as well as its Google-made apps — everything from the excellent calling-related features in the Pixel Phone app to the splendidly useful reminder system built into the Pixel Screenshots app on more recent Pixel models.</p>



<p>It’s even true in apps that seem so basic and utilitarian, you’d never think they had <em>anything</em> interesting lurking in their dusty virtual corners.</p>



<p>Today, it’s time to explore one such app — the seemingly mundane Pixel Clock app that came preinstalled on your phone. The Clock app may appear to be a simple spot for setting an alarm or timer, but don’t let yourself be fooled: Beneath its second-ticking surface, that unassuming part of your Pixel has some powerful options that’ll make your life a whole lot easier.</p>



<p>Oh, and if you <em>don’t </em>have a Pixel, don’t worry: While the Clock app is the default time-keeping tool on Google’s self-made phones, you can actually <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download it for free on <em>any </em>Android device</a> and get the same exceptional experience this second, even outside of the Pixel universe.</p>



<p>All right — ready to see all the cool stuff your phone’s Clock app can do?</p>



<p><strong>[Psst: Don’t stop here. Give yourself all sorts of advanced Pixel intelligence with </strong><a href="https://theintelligence.com/pixel-academy-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>my free Pixel Academy e-course</strong></a><strong>. Seven full days of experience-enhancing sorcery!]</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-1-custom-recurring-alarms">Google Pixel Clock trick #1: Custom recurring alarms</h3>



<p>If you’re anything like me, you probably find yourself getting up at different times for different purposes — y’know, the standard workday time, the weekend or holiday time, and maybe even the pretending-to-be-a-platypus wacky Wednesday time (or whatever it is <em>you</em> do to celebrate the middle of the week).</p>



<p>Well, stop futzing around with adjusting your alarms each time your wakey-wakey needs vary and start taking advantage of your Pixel Clock’s custom recurring alarm features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First and foremost, on the main Alarm tab within the Clock app, tap the circular plus button at the bottom of the screen to add extra alarms into your list.</li>



<li>Tap the “Add label” option within each card to give it a name that’ll let you know what it is at a glance (even when your eyes are bleary and your brain is 94% offline).</li>



<li>Remember, too, that you can keep any alarms you create off and available only for manual activation when you need ’em — <em>or</em> you can flip the toggle within their cards into the on position and select certain days of the week to have ’em automatically activate on a regular weekly schedule.</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>And all of that’s just the start.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-2-advanced-alarm-pausing">Google Pixel Clock trick #2: Advanced alarm pausing</h3>



<p>In a relatively recent twist, once you’ve got an alarm scheduled and set to recur on some regular schedule, you’ll see a snazzy new option to <em>pause</em> it — which is a bit confusing on the surface but could actually be quite handy in the right sort of situation.</p>



<p>So here’s how it works: With any alarm that has at least one recurring day selected, you can tap “Pause alarm” immediately beneath its schedule, within the Clock app’s Alarm tab, and then select a series of dates on which you <em>don’t</em> want the alarm to be running.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>That way, if you’re planning a week of vacation or any sort of shift from your standard schedule, you can tell your phone to stop sounding your regular alarm during that specific period — but then to automatically pick back up with it right after. And you won’t have to worry about forgetting to reenable your alarm after your downtime is done.</p>



<p>Good to know, no?!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-3-custom-wake-music">Google Pixel Clock trick #3: Custom wake music</h3>



<p>In addition to your Pixel’s built-in alarm sounds, you can connect your Clock app to a handful of different music services and wake up to the likes of System of a Down, Rage Against the Machine, or whatever soothing morning music you prefer.</p>



<p>If you’re using Google’s Clock app on a Samsung phone, this is an especially noteworthy upgrade over the Clock app that came preinstalled on your device — one Samsung is <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-clock-app-youtube-music-integration-one-ui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>>slowly </span></em>working to catch up to</a> but still nowhere near close to matching.</p>



<p>Here in the Pixel Clock app arena, though, all you’ve gotta do is get that connection set up once:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tap the sound configuration line within any of the alarms in your Pixel Clock app’s Alarm tab. It’ll be directly beneath the day selector when the card is expanded, and it’ll have a bell icon likely followed by the word “Default.”</li>



<li>Now, here’s the hidden part: <em>After </em>you’ve opened those alarm sound settings, tap the three-dot menu icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>That’ll reveal options to install and connect compatible sound services.</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Pick whatever service you prefer, and you’ll then see a tab for that service within the same “Alarm sound” screen. From there, it’s simply a matter of browsing through your available options within the service’s library — or tapping the search icon in the lower-right corner of the screen to find something specific — and picking the song or playlist most likely to annoy the living daylights out of anyone else sleeping in your vicinity.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Ahh — nothing like a gentle start to the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-4-specialized-sounds">Google Pixel Clock trick #4: Specialized sounds</h3>



<p>If the custom music isn’t cuttin’ it for ya, take note: Your Pixel Clock app <em>also</em> allows you to select any other standard sound file to use as your alarm audio.</p>



<p>Just download whatever file you want onto your device (or transfer it over from a computer), then:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tap any individual alarm within the Clock app’s Alarm tab.</li>



<li>Tap the line with the current alarm sound — like “Default (Fresh Start)” — next to the little bell icon.</li>



<li>Look for the “Add new” option.</li>
</ul>



<p>Smash your favorite phalange down on that option, and you’ll then be able to select any compatible sound file from your local phone storage or from any connected cloud services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-5-vocal-variety">Google Pixel Clock trick #5: Vocal variety</h3>



<p>One more potentially alarming alarm option to chew over is the Pixel Clock’s amusing ability to let you record your <em>own</em> self-made sound for an extra-special (and/or terrifying) wake-up experience.</p>



<p>Just follow the same steps we just went over — only this time, look for the “Record new” option within an individual alarm’s sound settings.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Bonus points if you manage to work a convincing Al Pacino impression into your recording.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-6-automated-automation">Google Pixel Clock trick #6: Automated automation</h3>



<p>An especially cool trick in Google’s Pixel Clock arsenal is the app’s ability to connect to Google Assistant (which, yes, is still around in some forms, despite the ongoing march toward Gemini as a replacement) and trigger all sorts of automated actions as part of any alarm you set.</p>



<p>Back in the app’s Alarm tab, expand an alarm’s card and look for the “Google Assistant Routine” option. Tap that son of a dingus, and you’ll be taken to a screen where you can configure all sorts of extra actions to accompany your waking.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>The options are virtually endless: Anything Assistant can do on your Pixel can be added into the mix — things like reading out info about your day, adjusting various phone settings, turning on or off any manner of connected device, and even interacting with third-party apps in all manners of interesting ways.</p>



<p>Hey Google: Any chance you can whip up some freshly made biscuits while you’re at it?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-7-wake-up-weather">Google Pixel Clock trick #7: Wake-up weather</h3>



<p>This next trick seems to be limited only to scenarios where Google’s Clock app is running on a Pixel device, specifically — sorry, non-Pixel pals! — but if you’re in such a situation, take note of the nifty line that says “Weather forecast” within the expanded view of any alarm on the app’s Alarm tab.</p>



<p>Activating that will allow you to see an instant overview of the current weather in your area as soon as you dismiss an alarm. It’ll just pop up automatically, as a full-screen forecast with the option to get even more detail.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>The forecast for today and every other day an alarm is set, incidentally, is sleepy with a strong chance of surliness. Consider yourself warned.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-tricks-8-9-and-10-custom-alarm-behaviors">Google Pixel Clock tricks #8, 9, and 10: Custom alarm behaviors</h3>



<p>On a more foundational level, your friendly neighborhood Pixel Clock app can let you take total control of how your alarms act and how <em>you</em> interact with ’em.</p>



<p>Tap that three-dot menu icon in the upper-right corner of the Clock app’s main screen and select “Settings” from the list that comes up. Then pay careful attention to a trio of important yet easily overlooked options:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Within the “Alarms” section, “Silence after” lets you customize exactly how long your alarm will harass you before giving up and shutting its virtual yap.</li>



<li>In that same area of the screen, “Snooze length” allows you to shorten or extend the number of minutes your Pixel Clock will let you rest before attempting to buzz you out of bed again.</li>



<li>And also in that section, “Volume buttons” will empower you to reprogram your Pixel’s physical volume keys so that they either snooze an active alarm or stop it entirely instead of simply adjusting its volume — an excellent set of choices for anyone who finds fumbling with the screen first thing in the morning as irksome as I do.</li>
</ul>



<p>Oh, and one more thing worth noting on this front…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-11-the-gentle-volume-phaser">Google Pixel Clock trick #11: The gentle volume phaser</h3>



<p>Hearing any sound at full blast is an unfortunate way to welcome yourself back to the land of the living. Your Pixel phone has a more pleasant option, though — if you find it and take the time to turn it on.</p>



<p>In that same Clock app settings area we were just exploring, you’ll see lines labeled “Gradually increase volume” under both “Alarms” and “Timers.” Tap either or both of those lines, and hey — wouldya look that?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Play around with the options, see what works best for you, and enjoy a <em>slightly</em> less jarring start to your next busy work/platypus day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-12-simpler-snoozing">Google Pixel Clock trick #12: Simpler snoozing</h3>



<p>While we’re on the subject of unwanted waking, if you start your days as foggy and groggy as I do, Google’s Pixel Clock app has a helpful way to stop an alarm without so much as lifting a single fingie.</p>



<p>So long as you’ve got Google Assistant/Gemini enabled with hands-free “Hey Google” activation — and if you aren’t sure, search your system settings for <strong>Assistant settings</strong> and then pull up the “Hey Google” section — you can silence any active Clock app alarm simply by saying <strong>Hey Google, stop</strong> or <strong>Hey Google, snooze</strong>.</p>



<p>Better yet, if you’ve got a reasonably Pixel phone with support for Google’s Quick Phrases system — available on the Pixel 6 and up, with English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, or Spanish set as your primary language — you can actually skip the “Hey Google” and <em>just</em> say <strong>Stop</strong> or <strong>Snooze</strong> to make the same thing happen.</p>



<p>Head back into those same Assistant settings and seek out the “Quick phrases” option to make sure you’ve got it activated, then mumble away in the morning without a worry in the world.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-13-simple-syncing">Google Pixel Clock trick #13: Simple syncing</h3>



<p>If you’re using a Pixel phone and a Pixel Watch, be sure to dig into the Google Clock app’s settings to find the “Alarm sync” option.</p>



<p>That simple-seeming toggle will let you connect the alarms on your phone and watch so they’re one and the same and any alarms set on one device will <em>also</em> be set and present on the other.</p>



<p>You can choose whether you want alarms to ring on both your phone <em>and</em> watch or if you’d rather use an “Adaptive ringing” option that automatically sounds the alarm only on whichever device you’re actively using at the moment it’s scheduled to occur.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Just set it and forget it. What more could you ask for?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-14-the-timer-time-saver">Google Pixel Clock trick #14: The timer time-saver</h3>



<p>Here’s a neat one I didn’t actually notice myself until years into my personal Pixel journey: In your Pixel Clock’s Timer tab, you can create multiple persistent timers and then keep ’em readily available for easy ongoing use.</p>



<p>That way, if you have specific types of timers you use time and time again, you can pull ’em up quickly and get ’em going — without wasting any time.</p>



<p>To get started, look for the circular plus icon toward the bottom of the Timer tab <em>after</em> you’ve tapped in some amount of time and started a timer going. Once you’ve created some specific timers and set ’em up the way you want, be sure to tap the title above each one to customize it and give it a nice name for easy at-a-glance identifying.</p>



<p>You’ll then have on-demand access to all those different timers anytime you need ’em in the future.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>‘Bout time you got this going!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-15-timed-sleep-sounds">Google Pixel Clock trick #15: Timed sleep sounds</h3>



<p>Speaking of timers, your Pixel Clock companion has a tucked-away option that might just help you function a bit better on your busy workdays by getting a good night’s sleep.</p>



<p>Tap the tantalizing Bedtime tab at the app’s bottom edge and look for the section called “Sleep sounds.” (You might have to first tap a “Get started” option and do some initial setup, if you’ve never before accessed that area.)</p>



<p>Tap the “Choose another sound” button on the screen that comes up next, and you can select from a small handful of relaxing noises — waves, deep space, dial-up modem screech, and so on.</p>



<p>Then, when you hit the play button back on the Bedtime tab, your sound of choice will start playing — and you can tell the app exactly how long you want it to continue before shutting off and sending you away into a deep, relaxing slumber.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>(Just kidding about the dial-up modem screech, by the way — though if you really want to add that into the lineup, you can download it from this Wikipedia page and then use the specialized sounds option we went over a minute ago to make it available. You’re welcome — and, simultaneously, apologies.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-16-a-custom-bedtime-schedule">Google Pixel Clock trick #16: A custom bedtime schedule</h3>



<p>Also on the subject of bedtime, be sure to browse through the “Schedule” section of the Pixel Clock app’s Bedtime tab while you’re there. That area will let you set a simple schedule to have your phone automatically enter Do Not Disturb mode and optionally even adjust its screen into a less distracting black-and-white grayscale setting during your sleepy-time hours.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>You can either create a strictly time-driven schedule <em>or</em> check an option to have your bedtime mode turn on only when your Pixel is actively being charged during certain hours — a welcome bit of contextual intelligence to accompany those of us with irregular sleep patterns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-17-the-multiple-time-zone-tracker">Google Pixel Clock trick #17: The multiple time zone tracker</h3>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am an absolute nit when it comes to keeping track of multiple time zones. For whatever reason, at least one out of every five times, I end up mixing up the most basic time zone conversions and confusing my mushy ol’ man-noggin about when, exactly, some manner of event is occurring.</p>



<p>Your Pixel Clock app has a helpful way to make managing multiple time zones easier: In the Clock tab, tap the circular plus icon and search for any city you think about during the day. You can add as many cities in as you want, and you’ll then be able to see ’em all on the same screen — with a clear indication of the current time in each area and its exact difference from your location. On reasonably recent Pixel devices, you’ll also see the weather for each area right then and there for easy at-a-glance access.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>If you <em>really </em>want to go all out, you can also slap the Clock app’s handy world time widget onto your home screen for an even more accessible at-a-glance view of the same info. Long-press anywhere on your home screen and look for the widget-adding command to find it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-18-time-travel">Google Pixel Clock trick #18: Time travel</h3>



<p>Now, hang on: Don’t get <em>too</em> excited. This isn’t actual time travel in the DeLorean, Doc Brown, “Great Scott!” sense. But it <em>is</em> a supremely useful Pixel Clock option that’ll help you better keep track of the time whenever you’re traveling (whether via DeLorean or a more conventional transportation method).</p>



<p>The feature will automatically add an extra clock into your Clock app’s Clock tab — that same list we expanded a second ago — so you can always see the current time in your home city anytime you’re somewhere else, without any extra thought or effort.</p>



<p>You can confirm the feature is active and ready to roll on your phone by heading into the Clock app’s settings (via the three-dot menu icon in its upper-right corner) and looking for the “Automatic home clock” toggle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-19-second-precision">Google Pixel Clock trick #19: Second precision</h3>



<p>Prefer to track the <em>exact</em> time, down to the second? Google’s Clock app has got ya covered.</p>



<p>Gallop back into the app’s settings section one more time — and this time, look right toward the top of the list for a toggle to “Display time with seconds.”</p>



<p>Tap that toggle, and in a split second, you’ll see an added second-counter on the end of the current time within the Clock app’s Clock tab.</p>



<p>Easy peasy!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-20-a-secret-shortcut">Google Pixel Clock trick #20: A secret shortcut</h3>



<p>For the Pixel owners among us, you’ve got a simple built-in shortcut to zip into the Clock app anytime, from anywhere on your device. It’s just up to you to realize it’s there.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s really nothing to it: Just swipe down once from the top of your screen to open up your notification panel, then tap the current time in the upper-left corner of the screen.</p>



<p>That’s it. Who knew?!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-21-on-demand-alarm-info">Google Pixel Clock trick #21: On-demand alarm info</h3>



<p>No matter <em>what</em> type of Android device you’re using, you can add your own custom Quick Settings tile to have a one-swipe-away view of your next alarm <em>and</em> an easy way to open up the Google Clock app from anywhere.</p>



<p>Swipe down twice from the top of your screen to see your Quick Settings, then tap the pencil-shaped icon to edit it. (On some Samsung devices, you might have to tap a three-dot menu icon and then select an option to edit from there instead.) </p>



<p>Find the “Alarm” tile in the section showing unused Quick Settings options and drag it into any position you like within the active tiles area. Then, you can always see your next scheduled alarm right then and there, in your Quick Settings, and tap that tile to jump right over into the “Alarm” tab of the Google Clock app.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-pixel-clock-trick-22-simple-action-shortcuts">Google Pixel Clock trick #22: Simple action shortcuts</h3>



<p>Last but not least, one final Pixel Clock possibility to ponder: You’d never know it, but hiding within the regular ol’ Clock icon in your app drawer is a series of spectacular shortcuts for performing certain simple actions in a single swift step.</p>



<p>It’s part of Android’s oft-forgotten App Shortcuts system, and it can save you some serious time — <em>if</em> you remember to use it.</p>



<p>And it couldn’t be much easier to use: Just press and hold your finger onto the Clock app’s icon in your app drawer or on your home screen for a couple of seconds. And hey, how ’bout them apples?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>There, right in front of your suspiciously steamy nostrils, are one-tap options for creating a new alarm, firing up a new timer, and starting a stopwatch — as well as for launching the Clock app’s time-focused screensaver, in case that urge ever strikes. Any of those commands will launch the associated action in the blink of an eye, without any spelunkin’ around within the app’s menus.</p>



<p>And here’s one more bonus trick: If you find yourself using any of those options regularly, you can make it even easier to access by pressing and holding your finger onto it and then dragging it directly onto your home screen. See?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Now it’ll be just like any other shortcut on your home screen and never more than a single tap away.</p>



<p>Saving time in an app that’s all about seconds — it just doesn’t get much better than that.</p>
