<p>Nvidia's newest addition to the RTX 5000 series lineup, the RTX 5070 Ti, <strong>starts at $749</strong> <strong>in the US</strong> and <strong>Â£729 in the UK </strong>and is available for purchase starting today <strong>Thursday, February 20</strong>.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for a shiny new Blackwell card to put in your PC, unfortunately you are far from alone. The good news is, you've come to the right place. TechRadar's Computing team has our eyes glued to the retailers in this list so you can be the first to know where to buy the RTX 5070 Ti as stock changes.</p><p>We're also on the lookout for prebuilt gaming PCs and laptops with 5070 Ti cards already installed. These may be your best bet at getting an RTX 5070 Ti close to launch day for a reasonable price.</p><p>So be sure to bookmark this page - you won't want to miss any updates on these GPUs. If the RTX 5080 and 5090 are to be any indication, the 5070 Ti will sell out incredibly fast.</p>

<p>If you've been put off by the RTX 5080 and 5090s' price tags, I don't blame you. Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti card comes in at a much more palatable price point for a modern-day upgrade, and you still get the latest Nvidia advancements like fifth-gen Tensor cores and Multi Frame Generation.</p><p>They're likely to sell out nearly instantly, though. So be sure to have your alerts set and this page bookmarked if you plan to get one on launch day, February 20.</p>

<p>Stock for the RTX 5080 and 5090 seems to have disappeared just as quickly in the UK as in the US, so we doubt the 5070 Ti will prove to be much different. That's why it's important to have your bookmarks set and your alerts enabled at these retailers!</p>

<ul><li>These are the best graphics cards of 2025</li></ul>

<p>Good morning! Today's the day that the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti goes on sale. If Nvidia's previous RTX 5000 series launches are anything to go buy, expect stock to go live around 9am ET / 2PM GMT.</p><p>That's still a few hours away, so now is a good time to check out the retailers above, and make sure you're signed in to your accounts ahead of the GPUs going on sale.</p><p>This is because, like the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 GPUs that launched a few weeks ago, I expect the RTX 5070 Ti to sell out fast, so you'll want to make sure you're as prepared as usual. You don't want to have a new GPU in your shopping cart, only to find out when you come to pay that you need to sign in with a long-forgotten password.</p>

<p>So, why do we think the RTX 5070 Ti will sell out fast? Well, for a start, as I mentioned earlier, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 sold out incredibly quickly when they went on sale a few weeks ago, proving that there's a huge demand for Nvidia's latest GPUs.</p><p>Those two cards are high-end and very expensive GPUs, which makes the fact they sold out so fast even more impressive.</p><p>However, this doesn't bode well for RTX 5070 Ti stock availability. For a start, everyone who tried and failed to get a 5090 or 5080 will likely try to get a 5070 Ti, as reviews suggest it's an excellent card.</p><p>On top of that, the 5070 Ti has a much more affordable price tag, which should mean it'll be more popular than the premium GPU, so we could see even more people try to snag one.</p>

<p>So, there's going to be a big rush when the RTX 5070 Ti goes on sale - but there are some things we've learned from the earlier launches that can help improve your chances of getting one.</p><p>Firstly, I recommend you keep this page open throughout the day, as we'll be updating it live - and we'll be giving stock alerts when we find a retailer that is still selling 5070 Tis, and we'll link directly to the GPUs so you can quickly buy them.</p>

<p>Using this page to help you find stock will also keep you from being scammed or overpaying. Unfortunately, unscrupulous people will use the excitement and demand of the 5070 Ti to take advantage of people.</p><p>This could be done by selling fake cards, or (in a process known as 'scalping') buying real 5070 Tis and then selling them on for hugely inflated prices.</p><p>We'll only recommend trusted retailers that we know won't rip you off, and we'll only link to 5070 Ti models that are sensibly priced. With the RTX 5090 launch, I found several retailers selling the GPU for around $4,000 - a huge mark up. No matter how desperate you are to get a new 5070 Ti, you really don't want to pay obscene amounts just to get one. It's much better to wait until more stock arrives - trust me.</p>
<p>As well as the main retailers, we'll also check out less well known stores as well, as they can sell out more slowly as most people will check out the likes of Best Buy and Currys (in the UK) first.</p>

<p>As with previous GPUs that were subject to high demand, one alternative way of getting hold of one is by buying a pre-built gaming PC with the GPU installed.</p><p>While this might seem an expensive way of doing things, it can be worth it if you were thinking of upgrading several parts of your Pc at once. You could also sell your old PC if you no longer need it, and that could make the initial outlay more affordable.</p>
<p>And, while this might not be the case with the more affordable 5070 Ti, we have seen in the past inflated GPU prices which meant buying an entire PC with the GPU installed wasn't much more expensive than buying the GPU by itself! Considering you're getting other new components with an entire PC, it can end up being better value than you might first imagine.</p><p>So, we'll also highlight any great prebuilt gaming PCs that come with the RTX 5070 Ti as well.</p>
<p>Of course, we're still updating our where to buy the Nvidia RTX 5080 and where to buy the Nvidia RTX 5090 guides as well, though stock remains extremely low, so there's not too much to report at the moment.</p>
<p>Although its pricing and performance (the latter of which places it almost on par with the more expensive RTX 5080) could make the RTX 5070 Ti the de facto best pick of Nvidiaâs current crop of GPUs, finding one at retail price could prove difficult - and if it does, I'd feel compelled to say you should sit and wait.</p><p>That goes double for anyone who already has an RTX 4000 card; frankly, I'll be sticking with my RTX 4080 for a while, Multi Frame Generation be damned.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, mind you: DLSS 4 with Nvidia's newly boosted frame-gen tech is <em>seriously </em>impressive. I recently saw it in action in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and having used the first-gen iteration of the software, the difference is truly night and day.</p><p>It's still not perfect, but visual tearing, blurring, and artifacting while upscaled to 4K with frame-gen turned on is significantly reduced even against DLSS 3 on a 4000-series GPU, to the point where it's almost completely unnoticeable even when I'm actively looking for it. I spotted the occasional tiny bit of blurring on the HUD while driving and shooting at high speeds, but that was literally it - Nvidia's framerate-boosting features have come a long way since the comparatively iffy original DLSS.</p>
<p>Our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review just went live!<br><br>TechRadar's Components Editor, John Loeffler, put the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti through its paces in our comprehensive benchmark suite of creative, AI, and gaming testing.</p><p>The results speak for themselves - the RTX 5070 Ti looks to be the best graphics card currently on the market for most systems...if you can manage to buy one. Read the full review for an outstanding in-depth breakdown of the RTX 5070 Ti's performance and value proposition.</p>
<p>Honing in on 4K gaming, the RTX 5070 Ti puts up some impressive numbers at its MSRP of $749. That said, as we discuss in our review, without a Founders Edition 5070 Ti to serve as a baseline, that price is more of a suggestion than a steadfast rule for partner cards.</p><p>Still, if you can find a 5070 Ti for a respectable price, you're looking at "31% better overall average FPS than the RTX 4070 Ti and about 23% better average FPS than the RTX 4070 Ti Super" per our benchmark tests.</p><p>The graph below has some customization options - use the top drop down bars to select different test results and single out specific GPUs, like the RTX 5070 Ti vs the RTX 4070 Ti.</p>
