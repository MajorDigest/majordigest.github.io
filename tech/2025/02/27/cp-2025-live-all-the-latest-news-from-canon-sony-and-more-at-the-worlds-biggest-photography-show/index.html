     <p>Welcome to our live coverage of CP+, the world’s largest camera and video show which takes place every year in the Pacifico, Yokohama, a suburb of Tokyo in Japan, since it debuted in 2010.</p><p>The show opened to the public on February 27 and the doors close on March 2. With the likes of Photokina in Germany no longer taking place, CP+ is the perfect opportunity for many camera and lens manufacturers to reveal their best cameras, lenses and accessories.</p><p>We’ve certainly heard no shortage of rumors and big announcements running up to this event and we've taken a good look around on Day 1. We're continuing our live coverage with all the latest news and reactions on what's been on show. So buckle in as discuss all things new from Canon, Sony, Sigma and Panasonic.</p>

<p>We're at CP+ 2025, psyched to see what new camera gear in store for us. For the general public, this is the first chance to get a look at new gear already announced this week, including the Canon PowerShot V1 vlogging compact, the radically minimalist Sigma BF, and Sony's monster 400-800mm super-telephoto zoom lens.</p><p>We've already had hands-on time with some of this gear, but it will be interesting to see which cameras and lenses draw the biggest crowds, and we're hoping to find some lesser-known treats.</p><p>This is the ideal place for the likes of third-party lens manufacturers to showcvase their latest optics, such as Cosina / Voigtlander. Without further ado, let's dive in!</p>
<h3 id="a-radically-minimalist-sigma-bf-2">A radically minimalist Sigma BF</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span></div></div></div>
<p>First stop, Sigma!</p><p>For camera enthusiasts, Sigma made waves this week with its new BF full-frame camera, plus two impressive new lenses, as well as a whole new look with a rebranded Sigma logo. The company doesn’t appear to be wasting any time either and is proudly displaying all three for the general public to see at the Sigma stand in this year’s CP+. Let's look at the Sigma BF first...</p><p>...starting with its rather quirky and unique design and feature set. We're told the metal body is made from a single aluminum ingot over 7 hours, while the user interface is properly stripped back – reminding us a little of the Leica CL. Sigma's compact 24MP full-frame camera has already caused quite a stir online in the past few days, and now guests at CP+ are seeing what all the fuss is about.</p>
<h3 id="sigma-s-monster-300-600mm-f-4-pro-super-telephoto-lens-2">Sigma's monster 300-600mm f/4 pro super-telephoto lens</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span></div></div></div>
<p>While Sigma caught us off guard with the BF camera at Monday's unveiling, there were way more rumors about a new lens. Those rumors ultimately proved unfounded, with many people speculating a fixed 800mm lens – we got two lenses instead; the 300-600mm f/4 DG OS for full-frame cameras, and the 16-300mm f/3.5-6.7 DC OS for APS-C, and they're here at Sigma's stand.</p><p>It's the super-telephoto zoom that's getting the most attention – it's monstrously big! It's a pricey lens for pros available for L-mount and Sony's E-mount cameras, and which is said to be the same size and weight as a 600mm f/4 lens, but with the advantage of having that wider reach. It also delivers up to 5.5 stops of optical image stabilization.</p><p>It's a heavy thing, mind – cue the show-offs touting the lens. This feels like being in the gym. Think we'll look for something smaller...</p>
<h3 id="sigma-s-travel-lens-with-world-s-biggest-optical-zoom-range-2">Sigma's travel lens with world's biggest optical zoom range</h3>
<p>In the 300-600mm lens' shadow? A new 16-300mm f/3.5-6.7 DC OS superzoom lens, which boasts an incredible zoom range, that should make it ideal for travel photography. Apparently it has the biggest optical zoom range of any mirrorless lens – a mega 18.8x zoom. It may not steal the headlines in the same way as the BF camera and 300-600mm lens, but this could just be our favourite of the three new Sigma products.</p><p>It’s available for L-mount, Sony E, Fujifilm X and also Canon RF - taking Sigma’s tally of APS-C lenses for Canon RF now to a total of seven. Sadly, there’s still no news on any third-party lenses for Canon's full-frame RF-mount cameras...yet.</p><p>All three of Sigma’s products are available to see and try at CP on stand 89.</p>
<h3 id="canon-s-compact-vlogging-camera-the-powershot-v1-2">Canon's compact vlogging camera, the PowerShot V1</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span></div></div></div>
<p>Next up on our CP+ tour...it's Canon.</p><p>It's a week ago today that Canon put out a teaser trailer announcing its brand-new PowerShot V1 vlogging compact. Sadly for most of the world, it's only available in Japan... for now. Good news for the lucky few including us... it debuts here at CP+ where the general public can catch a first glimpse...and it's seemingly drawing the biggest crowd.</p><p>People that made a beeline for the Canon stand when the show doors opened are hogging the V1, so we're admiring it from a distance for now.</p><p>We've already written some news about the V1 – although we didn't have a full picture of what it can do yet. One thing's for sure, it's a dinky, pocketable vlogging camera that's getting plenty of interest here.</p>
<h3 id="set-to-rival-the-sony-zv1-ii-2">Set to rival the Sony ZV1-II?</h3>
<p>From what we know so far, the PowerShot V1 is made for content creators. It can shoot 4K 10-bit video with Canon's Log 3 color profile, and features a tidy 16-50mm F2.8-4.5 lens. It's also compatible with external accessories such as a hotshoe microphones and flashes.</p><p>We're told it packs Canon's Dual Pixel CMOS AF II for the best autofocus performance of any Canon compact, and there's a flip-out vars-angle screen for easy self-recording for selfies and vlogging.</p><p>In the flesh, it looks a little larger than the Canon's trending G7 X Mark III, which we believe will remain on sale, and it also appears to have ventilation holes around body, much like we’ve seen on Canon’s EOS R5 Mark II, so could this video-first camera have some cooling features for decent record times?</p><p>Our first impressions? The PowerShot V1 most obvious rival is Sony's ZV-1 II. We'll be sure to get a proper hands-on of the V1 as soon as we can after the show.</p><p>Unfortunately there’s no sign of the rumoured Canon EOS R6 Mark III here. It's the PowerShot V1 that's the star of the show here.</p><p>Time for us to move on again...</p>
<h3 id="panasonic-s-best-ever-lumix-2">Panasonic's best-ever Lumix?</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span></div></div></div>
<p>If there was an award for the most capable camera debuting at CP+ 2025, it would go to the Panasonic Lumix S1R II.</p><p>The flagship mirrorless camera was unveiled just two days before the CP+ and largely kept under wraps in the show's lead up to CP+, and here it is at stand 88, home to an array of Panasonic gear for the next few days.</p><p>We already know the Lumix S1R II has a totally new 44MP full-frame sensor, and it will be the first full-frame camera with 8K 'open gate' video after a firmware update, plus 32-bit float audio recording via Panasonic's XLR adaptor.</p><p>Panasonic tells us that the Lumix S1R II's 8K video has 14EV of dynamic range when shooting 10-bit 8K movies at up to 30fps. This is a big upgrade from the Panasonic Lumix S1R if you major on video, but photographers might be happy to stick with the original S1R's 47MP stills and top LCD.</p><p>The form factor of the Lumix S1R II looks really tidy – it's evidently much smaller than the S1R and has more in common with the Lumix S5 II.</p>
<h3 id="lumix-s1r-ii-musings-2">Lumix S1R II musings</h3>
<p>We've actually been able to get hands-on with the Lumix S1R II ahead of the CP+ show, back in the UK, and you can find out more about Panasonic's flagship full-frame mirrorless camera in our hands-on Lumix S1R II review.</p><p>There's plenty to like about the Lumix S1R II; it's first-class for video and, depending where you are in the world, it is properly reasonable too – about half the price of the Sony A1 II (which we hope to get another play with later), 50% cheaper than the Canon EOS R5 Mark II, and roughly the same as a discounted Nikon Z8.</p><p>It might not be getting the same fanfare as Canon, but on capabilties alone, it deserves a proper look.</p>
<h3 id="two-new-lenses-at-sony-s-stand-2">Two new lenses at Sony's stand</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span></div></div></div>
<p>Squeaking in a day before CP+ 2025, Sony made a global announcement for two new lenses, and we've got our eyes on both of these optics at Sony's stand. Both E-mount lenses are made for Sony's full-frame mirrorless, but they couldn’t be more different from each other...</p><p>...we have a compact and affordable Sony 16mm F1.8 G wide angle prime, and a hefty Sony 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS telephoto.</p><p>It's the latter that of the two that is particularly interesting – so much so that people who want to try the Sony 400-800mm at the show need to a ticket and join a digital queue before being beckoned up to the balcony to give it a road test.</p><p>So what gives? Well, it has Sony’s most impressive reach of any Sony E-mount optic to date – in fact, it's Sony first-ever lens to reach 800mm. We reckon it's best for wildlife and sports subjects you can't get close to, like birds and motorsports. There's a severe lack of those subjects in the CP+ halls, mind...</p>
<h3 id="sony-s-super-wide-prime-lens-2">Sony's super-wide prime lens</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span></div></div></div>
<p>We wouldn't want to leave out the Sony 16mm F1.8 G lens. It's nicely compact – we've had a feel for it with the Sony ZV-E1 – and comes with all the bells and whistles that today's Sony lenses do; an aperture ring, minimal focus breathing, quiet and quick autofocus. But it's the fast f/1.8 maximum aperture which makes it brilliant for low light situations, such as astrophotography and indoor video work. Oh, and it's pretty cheap too... for a Sony lens.</p>
<h3 id="a-busy-show-2">A busy show</h3>
<p>We were at CP+ 2024 too, and last year the show was much quieter for new camera gear. 2025 on the other hand is positively buzzing – just a morning in and we've already had a look at three new cameras and several new lenses from some of the biggest names in photography.</p><p>The PowerShot V1 compact vlogging camera and Sony 400-800mm F6.3-8 lens are drawing a lot of interest, but the likes of the Sigma BF, Lumix S1R II and Sigma 16-300mm lens are super impressive each in their own way.</p><p>We'll be on the lookout for more new gear this afternoon, and hope to discover some hidden gems...</p>
<h3 id="voigtlaender-is-at-it-again-2">Voigtländer is at it again</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span></div></div></div>
<p>In 2024, we were captivated by some retro Voigtländer lenses, especially the Voigtlander Nokton D35mm f/1.2 for APS-C mirrorless cameras, attached to a Nikon Zfc. Naturally, we've made a beeline for the stand post lunch, where we have found the brand new Voigtländer Heliar 75mm f/1.8 – another stunner.</p><p>If you're attending the show, Voigtländer sits under the brand Cosina and can be founs at stand no.91. Despite its latest stunning lens being on display, Voigtländer couldn't tell us a price or release date.</p><p>What we do know, is that it's a solid metal lens that will initially be available only in Sony E-mount for now, though depending on the feedback received and significant demand, Voigtländer would consider bringing it to other camera mounts. We registered interest for a Nikon Z-mount version...fingers crossed.</p>
<h3 id="whoa-zeiss-is-back-2">Whoa, Zeiss is back!</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span></div></div></div>
<p>Adjacent to Voigtländer at Cosina's stand is Zeiss, and it's a big moment for the premium lens maker because it's displaying its first new lenses in over 10 years – its very first lenses for mirrorless cameras; the Otus ML 1.4/50 & Otus ML 1.4/85.</p><p>The Otus 50mm and 85mm lenses were actually announced two days prior to CP+ 2025, but this is the first public siting of the fast aperture prime lenses, displayed side by side. We've been told the 50mm lens is slated for an April release costing $2,500, while the 85mm will cost around $3,000 and come later in 2025.</p><p>Both lenses see the Zeiss Otus series make its way over to mirrorless cameras and are a little less expensive than the current DSLR offerings, even if they still cost a fair whack. Like their DSLR counterparts, these metal lenses are exclusively manual focus, are now now available for Sony E, Canon RF and Nikon Z mirrorless camera bodies.</p><p>We reckon these could be popular choices with portrait photographers who fancy something a little different optically, and who don't mind sacrificing the convenience of autofocus.</p>

<p>We've popped by to say hello to indie darling lens manufacturer 7Artisans, who was able to show us two exclusive new lenses to CP+.</p><p>The lenses in question are the 7Artisans 24mm f/1.8, which will initially be available in Nikon Z-mount cameras like the Zfc from March / April, with the Fujifilm X-mount version coming later in the year.</p><p>The second new lens from 7Artisans is a AstrHori 6.5mm f/2.0 fish-eye available for five mounts; Fujifilm X, Sony E, Nikon Z, Canon RF and MFT and is set to be available from March.</p><p>7Artisans is famed for its range of budget-friendly, high-quality lenses mainly for APS-C and full-frame cameras, including the L-mount, Sony-E and Fujifilm. There's SO many budget lenses on display here, some very tempting options and potential impulise purchases – if you’re attending CP+ this year, check out stand 47.</p>
<h3 id="a-totally-new-reveal-from-ttartisan-2">A totally new reveal from TTartisan</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span></div></div></div>
<p>Unlike most of the headline products that have been unveiled in the days leading up to CP+, TTartisan waited until the show opened to the public today to share its latest lens – the 14mm f/3.5 lens.</p><p>This wide-angle prime feels like a good find at the show – it's feather light at just 98g, making it ideal for photographers looking to travel light. Top tip – gently tossing a lightweight lens in the air is a joke that tends to fall flat.</p><p>That wide-angle focal length is a 21mm equivalent in full-frame terms, but the lens is available for APS-C mounts with Fujifilm X, Sony E and Nikon Z versions. Given it's lightweight build, it's pretty impressive (and surprising) that a stepping motor (STM) for fast and quiet autofocus is on board.</p><p>TTartisan wasn't able to confirm pricing for us, but we were told the aim is to launch the lens on March 21. If you’d like to see the tiny lens yourself at CP+, it's in the lens pit over at booth 49.</p>
<h3 id="more-third-party-lenses-with-tokina-2">More third-party lenses, with Tokina</h3>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 1</span></div></div></div>
<p>Tokina announced its new AT-X 11-18mm f/2.8 X lens on February 16, and we're setting eyes on it for the first time CP+.</p><p>It's a new wide-angle zoom just for Fujifilm X-mount cameras; portable, light and with a compact form factor ideal for Fujifilm mirrorless APS-C cameras – they've got it mounted to a previous-gen Fujifilm X-S10 at the Tokina stand.</p><p>The 1.5x sensor crop gives the lens a full-frame equivalent of 16-27mm focal length approx, while the maximum f/2.8 aperture is constant throughout the zoom range. We reckon this looks like a compelling Fujifilm alternative for landscape, astro and street photography, as well as vlogging. It weighs just 320g and has a length of just 74.4mm. Global sales are slated for March 14th, sneak peaks available at the Tokina stand now!</p>

<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span></div></div></div>
<p>Another leading third-party lens maker, Samyang, is here at CP+ 2025 with its first independent booth, over at booth 89 in Hall D. Here it is teasing a first look at a brand-new 2025 release – the Samyang AF 14-24mm F2.8.</p><p>The wide-angle zoom for Sony full-frame cameras is unlike Sony's own 14-24mm F2.8, because it's the first of its kind to accept front filters, with a 77mm front filter thread. Sony's bulkier version has a bulbous front lens element meaning it can't easily accept filters – an accessory that many landscape photographers in particular regularly use. Of course, Samyang's lens will be much cheaper than Sony's version too.</p>

<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 6</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 6</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 6</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 6</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 6</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 6 of 6</span></div></div></div>
<p>We're getting to close to the end of the day here, and it has been jam-packed with first-looks of cameras and lenses, plus we've also spotted some neat-looking accessories too.</p><p>Special mention goes to Kenko's new heated lens filters. They plug into your camera's USB-C port and warm up to stop condensation forming on them during particularly cool weather.</p><p>We've also said hello to the Manfrotto team who showed us redesigned 055- and 190-series tripods – the 'AS' versions feature an industry-standard Arca-Swiss plate. The tripods also have a brand-new all-black aesthetic, replacing the old-style silver finish on the leg locks and leg angle adjuster buttons on the previous models.</p><p>The new all-black look should appeal more to wildlife photographers wanting to be stealthy – the previous design with reflective silver metal can potentially alert wild animals to your location.</p>
<h3 id="till-next-time-cp-2">Till next time, CP+</h3>

<p>What a day! <br><br>It's been lovely to see the excitement at CP+ 2025 especially for newly announced gear, following quieter years and the show's absence during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>There was a particular buzz around the Canon and Sony stands, and Sigma's stand out BF camera. We hope the show continues growing for next year's instalment. <br><br>But now, we're bidding CP+ farewell and off to rest weary feet. We'll return later to this blog with reaction to what we've seen here today. Stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="let-s-talk-about-zeiss-2">Let's talk about Zeiss</h3>

<p>We've already had a look around the stands at CP+ 2025 and seen the new photography gear on display, but we absolutely <em>have</em> to discuss the return of Zeiss!</p><p>It might not seem like the German lens maker has taken a long hiatus, as the brand has been popping up in the smartphone world. It's latest partnership has been with Vivo, producing the lenses for the likes of the Vivo X90 Pro. But the last time Zeiss released optics for cameras was about six years ago – the Otus 100mm f/1.4 for DSLRs.</p><p>Making a comeback with its Otus line for mirrorless cameras is definitely a talking point because we know that most Zeiss lenses made in the past were absolute workhorses, offering excellence with each shot. If the same ethos is carried forward, it would bode well for photographers, giving them more options to choose from, no matter which system they're loyal to.</p><p>It would be interesting to see if (and how) the new Zeiss lenses shake up the photography industry. Admittedly the Otus line has always been premium glass, but Zeiss also made more affordable options too, none of which compromised on performance.</p><p>We certainly can't wait to try the new glass and have high expectations.</p>
<h3 id="techradar-picks-the-most-popular-product-at-cp-2">TechRadar picks: the most popular product at CP+</h3>
<p>It has to be the Canon PowerShot V1, surely!</p><p>While it's supposed to hit Asian markets only first, it's poised to give Sony a run for its money. And with a new generation of users reviving the G7 X series, the V1 is looking at a stellar start already.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div>
<p>We've already covered the news of the PowerShot V1's release and mentioned it yesterday during our Day 1 coverage, but we've been so impressed with what we've already seen that we think it could be 2025's vlogging star.</p><p>And while it might be geared towards video capture, it's very much a hybrid camera too. With features like 30fps burst shooting (albeit with the electronic shutter) and some filters thrown in, it might make for some creative stills. We really can't wait to spend some quality time with it when we can.</p>
<h3 id="canon-announces-20th-asian-games-sponsorship-2">Canon announces 20th Asian Games sponsorship</h3>
<p>With a karate demonstration to mark the occasion, Canon used the opening ceremony of CP+ 2025 to announce its sponsorship of the 20th Asian Games.</p><p>Aichi-Nagoya 2026 will see over 10,000 athletes from 45 countries compete in 41 sporting events, and will mark 75 years since the first Asian Games were held in New Delhi, India, back in 1951.</p><p>Canon has sponsored the previous two Asian Games as well, so this isn't new territory for the camera maker. This partnership will see Canon provide the Games' organizers cameras and lenses for both stills and broadcast, and will include the Canon EOS R1 and Canon EOS R5 Mark II. The company will also provide other supporting equipment and full technical support, including printers and medical devices.</p>
<h3 id="techradar-picks-the-most-exciting-product-at-cp-2">TechRadar picks: the most exciting product at CP+</h3>

<p>Our vote goes to the Sigma BF.</p><p>This "radically simple" camera might come across as weird and quirky, but 'radical' is definitely the right word for it. It's this utterly strange design choice that makes the Sigma BF so exciting.</p><p>We've only seen it at the Sigma stand at CP+, but the fact that it has no grip, practically no buttons, no memory card slot, no EVF, no hot shoe... are we missing anything else? – oh yes, just the one command dial – is taking camera design to way less than what we'd consider the bare necessities these days.</p><p>According to Sigma, even the menu system is minimalistic, which gives you just the bare necessities that the physical design doesn't seem to.</p><p>Whether this camera is a risky venture for Sigma remains to be seen, but we're absolutely in love with it... and we haven't even tried it yet!</p>
