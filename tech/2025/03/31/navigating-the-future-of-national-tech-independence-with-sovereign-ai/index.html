<p>Sovereign AI refers to a national or regional effort to develop and control artificial intelligence (AI) systems, independent of the large non-EU foreign private tech platforms that currently dominate the field. It represents a strategic push by countries or regions to ensure they retain control over their AI capabilities, align them with national values, and mitigate dependence on foreign organizations. There are two main considerations associated with the fundamentals of sovereign AI: 1) Control of the algorithms and the data on the basis of which the AI is trained and developed; and 2) the sovereignty of the infrastructure on which the AI resides and operates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="core-principles-of-sovereign-ai">Core principles of sovereign AI</h3>



<p><strong>Strategic autonomy and security</strong></p>



<p>Countries, whether individually or collectively, want to develop AI systems that are not controlled by foreign entities, especially for critical infrastructure, national security, and economic stability. This is essential for strategic autonomy or reliance on potentially biased or insecure AI models developed elsewhere​​.</p>



<p><strong>Cultural relevance and inclusivity</strong></p>



<p>Governments aim to develop AI systems that reflect local cultural norms, languages, and ethical frameworks. This ensures AI decisions align with local social values, reducing the risk of bias, discrimination, or misinterpretation of data​​.</p>



<p><strong>Data sovereignty and privacy</strong></p>



<p>With data being a key driver of AI development, countries prioritize keeping their data within their borders. This ensures data privacy, security, and compliance with national laws, particularly concerning sensitive information​​. It is also a way to protect from extra-jurisdictional application of foreign laws.</p>



<p><strong>Economic growth and innovation</strong></p>



<p>Sovereign AI offers the opportunity to boost domestic AI innovation, improve competitiveness, and protect intellectual property from foreign control. This allows countries to maintain leadership in emerging technologies and create economic opportunities​.</p>



<p><strong>Ethics and governance</strong></p>



<p>Governments are concerned about the ethical implications of AI, particularly in areas such as privacy, human rights, economic dislocation, and fairness. Ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and aligned with national laws is a key priority​​.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="core-eu-regulations-beyond-gdpr-impacting-sovereign-ai">Core EU regulations beyond GDPR impacting sovereign AI</h3>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">Broadcom</p></div>



<p><strong>EU AI Act (Artificial Intelligence Act)</strong></p>



<p>The EU AI Act, which is slated for full enforcement in 2025, is one of the first comprehensive regulatory frameworks for AI at the global level. It is a risk-based regulatory framework that aims to ensure that AI is used safely, ethically, and in a way that respects fundamental rights. The AI Act establishes a classification system for AI systems based on their risk level, ranging from low-risk applications to high-risk AI systems used in critical areas such as healthcare, transportation, and law enforcement​​.</p>



<p>The EU AI Act will shape how AI algorithmic systems are built and used within national borders, particularly countries that plan to deploy high-risk AI systems like facial recognition or AI in healthcare. Compliance with the AI Act ensures that AI systems adhere to safety, transparency, accountability, and fairness principles. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High-risk AI systems must undergo rigorous testing and certification before deployment.</li>



<li>Transparency requirements mandate that users understand how AI models make decisions.</li>



<li>Accountability means clear chains of responsibility in the event of harms caused by AI systems​​.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>​​EU Data Act</strong></p>



<p>​​The EU Data Act, which went into effect in 2023, plays a key role in shaping the framework for Sovereign AI by improving data accessibility and governance across Europe. The Data Act aims to create new markets by making available device data not just to manufacturers but also users and third parties, it regulates among other things fair contract terms for data sharing and specific requirements to enable switching between cloud providers. The Data Act framework creates new possibilities to access data that could be used for AI training and development. It also regulates the terms under which organisations can avoid lock-in with a particular cloud provider, which is a key consideration when developing AI capabilities . </p>



<p>By focusing on data sharing and access, the Data Act helps organizations and governments unlock the potential of data-driven innovations, including AI. This is crucial for reducing risks related to AI training and enhancing the ability to develop competitive AI solutions by facilitating AI training through the availability of relevant data for a particular jurisdiction’s AI systems.</p>



<p><strong>Cybersecurity Act (NIS2 Directive)</strong></p>



<p>The NIS2 Directive focuses on improving the overall cybersecurity resilience of the EU by setting common cybersecurity standards across member states. The act applies to critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, transport, and digital services, and mandates that entities adopt stronger cybersecurity measures and report major incidents to authorities.</p>



<p>Whilst nations develop Sovereign AI systems, the NIS2 Directive will enforce robust cybersecurity standards for AI technologies, particularly those deployed in critical infrastructure. Ensuring that AI systems are protected against cyber threats is crucial, especially for those involved in national security, health, or transportation​​.</p>



<p><strong>​​Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</strong></p>



<p>DORA significantly impacts Sovereign AI by establishing robust requirements for operational resilience, cybersecurity, and risk management within digital infrastructures of the financial industry and across their supply chain. As Sovereign AI systems increasingly become integral to critical sectors like finance, DORA ensures that these systems are resilient to cyber threats and operational disruptions and places a number of requirements on the downstream supply chain of the financial industry, ranging from operational resilience (including testing thereof), to transparency, performance monitoring and detailed contractual terms. </p>



<p>By enforcing standardized risk management protocols and incident reporting requirements, DORA effectively complements the EU AI Act by safeguarding the stability and security of critical AI-driven services delivered to a broad definition of the financial industry and across different service providers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="core-challenges-for-sovereign-ai">Core challenges for sovereign AI</h3>



<p><strong>Resource constraints</strong></p>



<p>Developing and maintaining sovereign AI systems requires significant investments in infrastructure, including hardware (e.g., high-performance computing GPU), data centers, and energy. Many countries face challenges in acquiring or developing the necessary resources, particularly hardware and energy to support AI capabilities​​.</p>



<p><strong>Talent shortages</strong></p>



<p>AI development requires specialized knowledge in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Countries must invest in education and workforce development to ensure they have the skills needed to compete in the global AI race​.</p>



<p><strong>Global interdependence and cooperation</strong></p>



<p>AI development relies on global data and collaboration. Countries must balance the desire for sovereignty with the reality that many AI technologies and infrastructures are interdependent, requiring cooperation across borders to be truly effective​​.</p>



<p><strong>Technological leadership and competitiveness</strong></p>



<p>To compete on the global stage, sovereign AI systems need to be technologically advanced. Developing state-of-the-art AI models comparable to those of major tech companies is a significant challenge due to the massive scale of investment and infrastructure required​.That said, most organizations do not find value in building their own foundation models from scratch. Instead, they leverage open source models fine-tuned with their custom data, which can often be run on a very small number of GPUs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-technology-of-vmware-private-ai-foundation-can-address-these-challenges">How the technology of VMware Private AI Foundation can address these challenges</h3>
