     <p>CinemaCon 2025 is underway, bringing together all the biggest movie theater owners, Hollywood studios and industry execs for a four-day showcase of presentations and screenings, and we're here to roundup the most important entertainment announcements in one place for you.</p><p>Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Discovery are in the spotlight today, following yesterday's slew of announcements from Sony. We're still yet to hear from Universal, DreamWorks Animation, Focus Features, Amazon MGM Studios, Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Studios, so stick with us for all the latest over the coming days.</p><p><strong>Big news so far:</strong><br>• <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/spider-man-4s-official-title-has-been-revealed-and-it-has-ties-to-a-controversial-time-in-the-marvel-heros-80-year-plus-comic-book-history">Spider-Man 4 is <em>Brand New Day</em>, and has a date</a><br>• <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/spider-man-beyond-the-spider-verse-finally-has-a-release-date-and-i-cant-believe-i-have-to-wait-so-long-to-find-out-how-miles-morales-story-ends"><em>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</em> has a 2027 date</a><br>• A <em>John Wick</em> animated prequel is coming with Keanu Reeves involved<br>• <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is the next Hunger Games movie, coming 2026<br>• <em>Now You See Me: Now You Don't</em> is the third in the magic-heist series<br>• The Beatles cast announced, all 4 movies coming in April 2026<br>• The Zelda live-action movie is planned for March 2027</p>

<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">'Much of our program tonight is going to focus on the people who actually make the movies'. - Tom Rothman #CinemaCon #CinemaCon2025April 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Don't worry if you're not at CinemaCon 2025, because we're here to make sure you don't miss out any of the biggest new movie announcements from the industry event.</p><p>The first big Hollywood studio presentation was from Sony Pictures, with CEO Tom Rothman kicking things off with a welcome speech. According to attendees that walked through the casino hotel doors of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas yesterday (March 31) evening, it sounds like it was a packed lineup of new movies with many directors taking the stage to promote their films.</p>

<p>Matt Bolton, Managing Editor for Entertainment, stepping in here to say that while we only got a very brief appearance from filmmaker Zach Cregger about his upcoming <em>Resident Evil</em> movie, I'm excited about this one – despite knowing very little about it.</p><p>Cregger directed the wonderfully bonkers <em>Barbarian</em>, and has a new movie planned for release during 2025 called <em>Weapons</em> starring Josh Brolin and Julia Garner, among others.</p><p>He spent his time on stage talking about how much he loves the video game series, and I'm sure fans of the series are looking forward to seeing what version of that he chooses to tap into.</p><p>I gotta say, I'm equally fine if he takes it off into its own direction – I unashamedly love (most) of the Milla Jovovich Resident Evil movie series, and that really benefited from finding its own vibe within the (ahem) umbrella of the franchise.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Beatles - A Four-Film Cinematic Event, directed by Sam Mendes. Harris Dickinson (John Lennon)Paul Mescal (Paul McCartney)Barry Keoghan (Ringo Starr)Joseph Quinn (George Harrison) In theatres April 2028. #TheBeatlesFourFilmCinematicEvent pic.twitter.com/mREL0nPcfCApril 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Perhaps the most <em>interesting</em> news of the show came about Sam Mendes' upcoming suite of movies about The Beatles. For a start, we got a big casting announcement of huge names playing the fab four:</p>
<ul><li>George Harrison: Joseph Quinn (<em>Fantastic Four</em>,<em> A Quiet Place: Day One</em>)</li><li>John Lennon: Harris Dickinson (<em>Babygirl</em>, <em>Triangle of Sadness</em>)</li><li>Paul McCartney: Paul Mescal (<em>Gladiator II</em>, <em>Aftersun</em>)</li><li>Ringo Starr: Barry Keoghan (<em>Saltburn</em>, <em>The Banshees of Inisherin</em>)</li></ul>
<p>In case you're not aware, the plan is to make four movies, each centering on a different member of the group. And the really juicy part is that all four movies are slated to come out during April 2028.</p><p>I have to say, I'm struggling with this one. That's quite a cast, and Mendes has made some great stuff, but I feel like people are going to be pretty burnt out by the time they come to Ringo's movie (and you <em>know</em> it's going to be poor Ringo last).</p>

<p>We also got news that the Spider-Verse conclusion, <em>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</em>, is coming on June 4th, 2027 – or, at least that's the plan. The movie has already had plenty of trouble hitting its dates, and was originally planned for a 2024 release.</p><p>Some of the creative team went on-stage during CinemaCon and presented a teaser with apparently great-looking new animation, but with audio taken from the previous movies.</p><p>If – like TechRadar's Senior Entertainment Reporter, Tom Power – you can't believe you have to wait so long to find out how Miles Morales' story ends, then the good news is that some first look images were posted on social media for fans to enjoy (see below).</p><p>Read more: Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse finally has a release date, and I can't believe I have to wait so long to find out how Miles Morales' story ends</p>

<p>One of the buzziest news tidbits out of CinemaCon so far is the reveal that the fourth Tom Holland/MCU Spider-Man movie will be called 'Brand New Day', and will be released on July 31st 2026 (one week after Christopher Nolan's <em>The Odyssey</em>, making it a great seven days for Tom Holland fans).</p><p><em>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</em> breaks from the 'home' naming convention of the first three movies, probably indicating a new approach to match its new director, Destin Daniel Cretton, who held <em>Shang-Chi</em> for Marvel previously.</p><p>Comic fans will instantly recognize the name 'Brand New Day', however, and probably won't have very good feelings about it – but we don't think the story will have anything major to do with the comic's story other than a name that evokes a fresh start.</p><p>Read more: Spider-Man 4's official title has been revealed – and it has ties to a controversial time in the Marvel hero's 80-year-plus comic book history</p>

<p>Amelia tapping back in here to bring you the latest on the new live-action Zelda movie!</p><p>There's no way Sony could make a presentation about its upcoming movies without mentioning its latest project with Nintendo to adapt the Zelda video game franchise. Unfortunately, however, attendees at the event reported that there wasn't much in the way of news.</p><p>It sounds like Nintendo took the wind out of Sony's sails because the video game publisher had already confirmed that the live-action Zelda movie got a release date of March 26, 2027 during Nintendo Direct.</p><p>Plot details and casting are being kept firmly under wraps for the moment, so make sure not to fall for any of those rumors lurking around online this April's Fools Day!</p>

<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div>
<p>My personal favorite bit of news from Sony's lineup has to be that a new trailer for <em>28 Years Later </em>was shown off.</p><p>The video has not yet been published online, but you can watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/i-cant-wait-to-watch-28-years-later-after-seeing-an-unexpected-cameo-in-the-trailer-that-had-my-jaw-on-the-floor">the first trailer for <em>28 Years Later</em></a> above to get an idea of what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have been working on for the third chapter of this zombie trilogy.</p><p>Taking to the stage, Boyle revealed that "Alex Garland and I set out to make three films in this world. Each one stands alone, but they're all linked together". The first of these films is <em>28 Years Later, </em>which is already finished, and the second is wrapping up production. <em> </em></p><p>Nia DaCosta, who wrote the script for the <em>Candyman </em>reboot, is the director for the second film, <em>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. </em>The second installment is also set to star British actor Ralph Fiennes, but DaCosta says that while audiences have seen him many roles, we've "never seen him like this".</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">'The script for The Bone Temple is very different than 28 Years Later and I was able to let my freak flag fly'. - Nia DaCosta #CinemaCon #CinemaCon2025April 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div>
<p>Sticking with all the new horror movies coming soon to theaters, there's also the new <em>Until Dawn </em>video game adaptation that's arriving on April 25, 2025. Even though the movie adaptation won't follow the same story, this one has a lot of people excited.</p><p>Next up on the docket is the sixth installment in the horror movie franchise <em>Insidious</em>, which Variety previously reported that co-producers Blumhouse Productions and Screen Gems were set to release the film on August 29, 2025. However, that has since been pushed back until August 21, 2026.</p><p>Last but certainly not least is the reboot of the 1990s slasher<em> I Know What You Did Last Summer. </em>Sony unveiled some first look images of the sequel that reportedly prompted cheers at CinemaCon when the movie's original cast Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr flashed up on screen. We'll be able to see for ourselves when it releases in cinemas on July 18, 2025.   <em> </em></p>

<p>Moving onto animation, the director of Sony's upcoming animated sports comedy <em>GOAT,</em> Tyree Dillihay, was on stage last night talking about the new film. There's not a lot out there about this at the moment but we do know that cinema goers will get to buy tickets for February 13, 2026 – the same time as NBA’s All-Star weekend in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>On the anime front, Sony has three new releases coming up. The first is the sequel to the Chainsaw Man anime series. Titled <em>Chainsaw Man: The Movie – Reze Arc</em>, the movie will open in cinemas in the US on October 29, 2025.</p><p>There's also the  upcoming international release of the final Demon Slayer movies, alongside the US release of <em>Scarlet, </em>which Sony acquired the rights for from critically-acclaimed director director Mamoru Hosoda (<em>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time; Wolf Children</em>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony has three major Anime releases upcoming, including a new Demon Slayer, new Chainsaw Man and a third title called Scarlett. #CinemaCon #CinemaCon2025April 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div>
<p>Matt here again! The next Avengers movie may not be until next year, but we've got an even more impactful cross-movie fighting team-up coming: <em>Karate Kid Legends</em>.</p><p>Starring original Karate Kid Ralph Macchio, newer sensei Jackie Chan, and full newcomer Ben Wang as our latest titular Kid, it's going to mix elements from every era of Karate Kid, taking place three years after the end of <em>Cobra Kai</em>.</p><p>A fresh trailer was shown, and Sony promised that it would be available to watch online today, April 1st (it promised this on March 31st, so it's probably no fool). You can watch the original trailer above, and the movie is rapidly approaching its May 30th release date.</p>

<p>What can we expect from Lionsgate's presentation later today? The company has a handful of relevant and hugely successful movie series, and chief among them is the 'world of John Wick'.</p><p>I use that that phrase advisedly, because <em>Ballerina</em> – which is officially called <em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em>, somewhat desperately – is coming on June 7th, so we're sure to get a big new trailer and an appearance from its star, Ana de Armas.</p><p>But I'd put my money on a surprise last-minute Keanu appearance too, and the reveal of <em>John Wick: Chapter 5</em> in a slightly more formal manner than an executive in an interview going "we’re working on a fifth John Wick film" more or less unprompted.</p>

<p>John Wick isn't Lionsgate's only money-making crown jewel, though. There's a new Hunger Games book out in 2025, called <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, and it's another prequel telling the story of a character from the original set of books.</p><p>After the success of <em>A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, I have to assume that no time will be wasted getting <em>Sunrise</em> into motion – I doubt we'll hear much, but perhaps director Francis Lawrence will return to announce he's starting work.</p><p>A star announcement would be fun – the book follows young Haymitch Abernathy, played by Woody Harrelson in the original movie run, so who's a good young Woody? I would have said Paul Mescal, but it's set when Haymitch is just 16, and I'm not sure he can pull off quite that much of a youthful turn. It'll probably be one of the <em>Stranger Things</em> kids – maybe we'll find out later today.</p>

<p>Warner Bros Discovery is also holding its event today, and I suspect a big announcement will be a name and rough release plan for the sequel to <em>The Batman</em>.</p><p>The sequel was originally announced at CinemaCon 2022, believe it or not, and filming still hasn't started yet. Supposedly, the hope has been to film at the end of 2025 for a 2027 release, but reports said that the script wasn't finalized as of the start of 2025, so who knows.</p><p>Well, maybe all will be revealed soon.</p>

<p>The other announced-but-sort-of-unknown movie hanging over Warners' head is <em>Dune Messiah</em>. Originally, director Denis Villeneuve said he wanted a break before tackling the (likely) finale to the story, but seems to have changed his mind and is working straight on it.</p><p>So does that mean a 2026 or 2027 release date? Probably! If pre-production is in full swing, I would expect a big update on the galactic atrocities to come.</p>

<p>Amelia here to bring your attention to Darren Aaronsky's new film, <em>Caught Stealing</em>. The Austin Butler and Zoë Kravitz-starring flick had a trailer shown during the Sony presentation yesterday that sounds like it was a home run.</p><p>The movie is inspired by Charlie Huston's, who also wrote the script, series of books of the same name and will see Austin play a former baseball player who gets into trouble with the criminal underbelly of 1990s New York.</p>

<p>After seeing Colin Farrell's incredible transformation into the ruthless Oz Cobb for the HBO Original series <em>The Penguin </em>last year, I can't wait to see what his next role will be.</p><p>The Irish actor is taking on a very different type of character for his next film, and it sounds like it will pull on the heart strings. <em>A Big Bold Beautiful Journey</em> is an upcoming romantic drama that will see Farrell star alongside Margot Robbie as two strangers on a whimsical journey through their memories.</p><p>If this is anything like <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, </em>then I'll be making sure to have tissues at the ready when it releases in theaters in the US on September 19, 2025.</p>

<p>Amelia just messaged me to say "And now my watch has ended", which is my cue – hi, hello, I'm Tom Power, TechRadar's senior entertainment reporter – to take over.</p><p>Anyway! As we mentioned earlier, Warner Bros. Pictures' presentation is coming later today – that's 4:30PM PT / 7:30PM ET, to be exact. With numerous DC Universe (DCU) in post-production and/or currently being filmed, we could get a substantial update on some of the most exciting DCU Chapter One movies and TV shows around.</p><p>So, what could be revealed at CinemaCon 2025? I'm hoping for a new teaser for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/james-gunns-superman-dcu-movie">James Gunn's <em>Superman</em> movie</a>. Failing that, I'd take a first look at Milly Alcock's Supergirl in her full superhero costume for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/supergirl-woman-of-tomorrow"><em>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</em></a> or an update on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/lanterns"><em>Lanterns</em></a>, which began filming last month. With so many rumors about the latter's cast circulating online, an official update to its roster wouldn't go amiss, please and thank you.</p>

<p>In the more immediate future, there are plenty of other exciting new films on the Warner Bros docket.</p><p>From the return of beloved horror movie series Final Destination in the form of <em>Final Destination: Bloodlines</em> (May 16) and the Brad Pitt-starring <em>F1 Movie</em> (June 27), to Leonardo DiCaprio's next film <em>One Battle After Another</em> (September 26) and <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> (October 24), there's a slew of great looking movies to keep tabs on.</p><p>Will Warner show us any new footage from any or all of the above? Hopefully! Don't be surprised if it showcases some movies set to arrive in April, too, including Michael B Jordan and Ryan Coogler's <em>Sinners</em> and Ben Affleck's <em>The Accountant 2</em>.</p>

<p>Alright, so Lionsgate's presentation is beginning shortly.</p><p>Before it does, though, a 'State of the Industry' panel is taking place. Indie studio Neon has kicked things off with a sizzle reel of its notable hits over the past 12 months, including the multi-award-winning <em>Anora</em>, as well as acclaimed horror films <em>The Monkey</em> and <em>Longlegs</em>, both of which were helmed by rising filmmaker Osgood Perkins.</p><p>Neon also showed some footage for two movies on its forthcoming slate, including <em>Together</em> and the Tom Hiddleston-starring <em>The Life of Chuck</em>. The latter is a film I'm really keen to see, so I'm hoping that a proper teaser is released soon-ish!</p>

New poster for Mike Flanagan's Stephen King movie, THE LIFE OF CHUCK. #CinemaCon pic.twitter.com/MpHciNOFBnApril 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>

<p>Well, it sounds like people enjoyed what the saw of <em>Together</em> and<em> The Life of Chuck</em>'s brand-new trailers!</p><p>Where the latter is concerned, it's been helmed by Mike Flanagan and Stephen King – yes, the horror auteurs themselves! – but it isn't a scary or gross film. In fact, based on the reactions I've already seen online, some attendees have likened it to <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> (one of my favorite films, FYI) in terms of its timeless and tear-jerking story. If I wasn't already excited for its release this June, I certainly am now!</p><p>As for<em> Together</em>: well, it's a romantic body horror movie that stars real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie. Judging by what attendees are saying on social media, it drew visceral reactions from the assembled crowd, who erupted into applause once the trailer had ended. I'm sure our resident horror expert Lucy Buglass will be seated for this on day one!</p>

<p>Alas, I must already bid you all adieu – but, fear not, dear reader, for I leave you in the very capable hands of Jacob Krol and Al Griffin, who'll guide you through the rest of the day's events.</p><p>Until tomorrow when I'll be writing up a whole host of DCU and/or <em>Ballerina</em> news stories, then, farewell!</p>

<p>Tom Cruise is known as a champion not just of movies, but of the moviegoing experience. Cruise didn’t make an appearance at CinemaCon today, but a video message was played for attendees where he continued his push to save the theatrical experience for future generations:</p><p>“Seeing a movie on the big screens can change lives… the cultural impact of movie theaters can’t be matched… the story of cinema is an iconic one but it’s only just begun.”</p><p>Of course, we also want to hear more details about the forthcoming Mission Impossible –the Final Reckoning, which is scheduled for a May 2025 release. Let’s hope news on that release drops before CinemaCon wraps!</p>

<p>Lionsgate's event is now underway!</p><p>First up is, predictably, <em>Ballerina</em> – the <em>John Wick</em> spinoff starring Ana de Armas. Director Len Wiseman went on stage with de Armas to show off a new trailer that showcases extra footage of an intense kitchen fight scene that is glimpsed in the previous trailers, and has the innovative use of weapons that you'd hope for from a film in this series.</p><p>Ana de Armas is also describing the intense training and filming methods used in the movie to get everything looking physically right.</p>
<p>That may not be the only John Wick universe movie we hear about today – Indiewire says than animated prequel movie showing John Wick's 'impossible task' mission that originally got him out of the murder business is coming – and it doesn't <em>appear</em> to be an April Fool, even though it hasn't been mentioned on stage.</p>
<p>Director Francis Lawrence and all-round legend Mark Hamill are on-stage to discuss <em>The Long Walk</em>, which might sound like '90s Oscar bait, but is a "brutal" (according to Hamill) Stephen King adaptation about people who must keep walking because if they stop, they're killed.</p><p>Francis Lawrence is also the director of the Hunger Games movies, which is a big Lionsgate franchise, so will he be back for today as we predicted earlier?</p>

<p>Ah, no need for Francis Lawrence to come back – he's moving straight onto the announcement that <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> has been in pre-production for a while already, and is on something of a fast-track to movie reality – it's coming on September 20th, 2026.</p><p>It's an adaptation of the latest Hunger Games prequel book, which follows Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson in the originals) as a 16-year-old who – and I don't want to alarm you – has a very bad time in the Hunger Games.</p>
<p>People keep asking if he's back. And we didn't really have an answer. But yeah, I'm thinking he's back.</p><p>That John Wick animated movie has been announced, with Keanu Reeves and Wick regular director Chad Stahelski both involved. But that's all the information we really have for now.</p>

<p>Leaving Lionsgate for a moment, it certainly sounds like there'll be plenty of <em>Superman</em> info around this week, with James Gunn promising an extended preview.</p>
<p>A couple of quick ones: Luca Guadagnino, maker of 2024's best movie (don't @ me) <em>Challengers</em> popped in to confirm what we already knew: he's making a new adaption of <em>American Psycho</em>.</p><p>There was also a trailer for Aziz Ansari's directorial debut, <em>Good Fortune</em>, which stars (him again) Keanu Reeves as an angel who body swaps Ansari with his boss, Seth Rogen, to try to teach a lesson about money not buying happiness. It does not go as planned.</p>
<p>Finally. FINALLY. The sequel to magician… heist… thriller(??) <em>Now You See Me</em> should always, very obviously, have been called 'Now You Don't'. But it was called <em>Now You See Me 2</em>.</p><p>Well, the surprise-hit series' third instalment was just announced as <em>Now You See Me: Now You Don't</em>, so I can die happy. Or, at least, temporarily sated that this particular missed opportunity is no longer missed.</p><p>A trailer was shown that reveals the return of key cast, plus newcomer Dominic Sessa, breakout star of <em>The Holdovers</em>. He has kind of a Jesse Eisenberg energy in that movie, so we'll see how it translates here.</p>
<p>Ah, we have the lightest of teasers for <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>. Enjoy some mood-setting molten liquid and snake skin.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the Michael Jackson biopic, <em>Michael</em> was mentioned as still coming, but with no real information – it seems like it's had a lot of problems in production, so we'll have to wait to hear more.</p>
<p>Paul Feig – director of <em>A Simple Favor</em> and one of my all-time favorite comedies,  <em>Spy</em> – has a new movie starring Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney called <em>The Housemaid</em>.</p><p>It's a book adaptation that bills itself as "An absolutely addictive psychological thriller with a jaw-dropping twist" in which a housemaid with a dark secret starts living with a family with a twisted matriarch, and the two clash in ways that Seyfried described as "bananas".</p><p>A first-look trailer was shown on-stage, though was light on plot.</p>
<p>The event is wrapping up, with the finale being a first look at <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em>, a stylish new thriller starring Jenna Ortega, Barry Keoghan and The Weeknd.</p><p>The Weeknd is then playing a set to round out the show, and it seems like that's everything Lionsgate has for us.</p>

<p>Warner Bros' event isn't until 4:30pm PT (7:30pm ET, 00:30am GMT), so there's a big pause until the next big flow of news – but we might get some tidbits in between.</p><p>Bigwigs from Neon and Universal will be on a panel later, for example. and might drop something juicy. Joseph Kosinksi, director of <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> and (more pertinently) the upcoming <em>F1</em> movie, is also on that panel.</p>
<p>Lionsgate's announcements was a solid set of stuff to look forward to, though I'd have loved a solid preview at the <em>John Wick</em> prequel.</p><p>But I'm totally on board for a Paul Feig thriller starring two of my favorite stars of today in Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney, and I enjoyed the last Hunger Games prequel, so I'm on board for more of the same.</p><p>I actually never got on with the <em>Now You See Me</em> movies, even though they couldn't not be more up my street – maybe I'll give them another go with the third coming, and I like Dominic Sessa, so here's hoping I'll come around.</p>

<p>In between the major keynotes at CinemaCon, I have some good news for fans of Dolby Cinema at AMC Theaters. While there are only a handful currently, the two brands announced on Monday, March 31, at CinemaCon that there will be a major expansion in the United States of these cinemas.</p><p>AMC Theaters will build and open 40 new Dolby Cinema screens in its theaters in the United States by the end of 2027. That’s close to a 25% increase in these auditoriums, and once complete, they will mean there are over 200 to watch and visit in the US.</p><p>I, for one, love Dolby Cinema – you get oversized, plush recliners but it’s all about the screen and audio. Thanks to a special projector, you get Dolby Vision on a massive scale with Dolby Atmos sound all around – these work together to really immerse you in the action. I even love the pre-roll showing the difference in color and sound in Dolby Cinema.</p><p>We’ll all need to eagerly wait and see where the new Dolby Cinema theaters are going.</p>

<p>Some further thoughts on director Luca Guadagnino adapting <em>American Psycho</em> from the acclaimed Bret Easton Ellis novel.<br><br>This isn’t the first time <em>American Psycho</em> has made it to the big screen. Back in 2000, director Mary Harron (<em>I Shot Andy Warhol</em>, <em>The Notorious Bettie Page</em>) delivered her own spin on Ellis’ novel, the highlight of which was a deliriously over-the-top performance by actor Christian Bale as deranged finance bro Patrick Bateman. According to Bloody Disgusting, Guadagnino stated at CinemaCon that no casting decisions have yet been made for the new <em>American Psycho </em>adaptation, but whoever gets to play Bateman will have some very big shoes to fill.</p>
<p>Hello! Matt Bolton, Managing Editor for Entertainment, tagging in here to take us through Warner Bros' announcements, which start in an hour.</p><p>And there's a <em>lot</em> that could come up today, because that company has a ton of stuff cooking.</p><p>We've already mentioned today the DCU, <em>The Batman</em>'s sequel and <em>Dune: Messiah</em>. But WB has a really strong line on long-awaited sequels coming up, too.</p><p><em>Heat 2</em>, <em>I am Legend 2</em>, <em>Constantine 2</em>, <em>Alien Legion</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum</em> are all potentials to show up today.</p>

<p>Let's talk about <em>I Am Legend 2</em> for a moment. This will supposedly star  Will Smith reprising his role from the first movie, along with Michael B. Jordan. Supposedly, it won't follow the ending you saw in the movie originally, but instead an alternative ending that's closer to the book.</p><p>The director of the original, Francis Lawrence, is in Las Vegas right now, having appeared at the Lionsgate event earlier today. But given that he was promoting <em>two</em> movies he has in the works right now, and will be tied up with the new Hunger Games film for the foreseeable future, I'm guessing he won't be picking up this one unless the release date is a while away.</p>

<p><em>Heat 2</em> is the movie I'm really hoping to hear something concrete about. The original movie is one of my favorites of all time, and it's the 30th anniversary this year (I just saw a rep screening of it on the big screen in celebration).</p><p>A recent interview with Vulture revealed that writer/director Michael Mann has turned in a script, and there have been rumors for years that Adam Driver, Austin Butler and Oscar Isaac are set to star, so maybe we'll finally get confirmation of any of that.</p><p>I also can't recommend that interview enough if you're a fan of Mann, by the way.</p>

<p>Let's talk about <em>The Batman</em>'s sequel. When the original came out, I was pretty middling on it – I loved Pattinson, the cinematography, the score, the overall vibe. I nearly fell out with a friend, however, when I called it "Baby's first <em>Se7en</em>", but I still think that's basically true.</p><p>Still, it sat well with me long term, and I've rewatched it when I want a movie I'm fond of to just wash over me – and it doesn't hurt that it's on regular rotation as one of the movies we use to test TVs.</p><p>So I've started to really look forward to the sequel, especially since it's not being rushed out, and the end of the original means it could go almost anywhere.</p><p>The big question is who the villains might be, since that'll tie strongly into the plot. I suspect it's unlikely to go wildly into the 'supervillain' tone, though I wouldn't bet against it. I also suspect that Barry Keoghan as Joker is probably not going to happen, although again it'd be stupid to rule it out (and Barry's in Las Vegas, having appeared for the cast reveal of The Beatles movies).</p><p>I think the best fit would be the Black Mask, a villain not used in any main Batman movies (an appearance in <em>Birds of Prey</em> is his only big-screen showing), but he really fits <em>The Batman</em>'s tone.</p><p>He was a kind of mirror of Bruce Wayne, the son of a rich family who was forced to befriend the Waynes but hated them for being phoney. His family also died – but he killed them. He built a business empire, but it was a disaster in every sense, and Bruce Wayne saved it and forced him out. He eventually becomes a sadistic gang boss.</p><p>All of which sounds like the perfect fit to keep exploring the Thomas Wayne scandal and crime power vacuums left open at the end of <em>The Batman</em>.</p>

<p>Do you think we'll hear anything about the long-mooted <em>Akira</em> movie, which WB has the rights for? Taiki Waititi was attached, then left it to make <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>, then supposedly was coming back to it after the Star Wars movie he was scheduled to make, which also seems to have vanished into the ether – but no word on him re-appearing on <em>Akira</em> after that.</p><p>Given the budget involved, I suspect it's fully on ice unless a really strong directorial name comes along to warrant it. James Cameron was attached once, and while there's no chance he comes back as long as he's working on roughly 27 Avatar movies, he's the right kind of name.</p><p>I suspect it'll go unmentioned, but you never know – maybe a Jordan Peele or Ryan Coogler will have put their name forward, assuming Taika's no longer involved.</p>

<p>I am assuming that we'll get some <em>Supergirl</em> information today – we've had our star, Milly Alcock (<em>House of the Dragon</em>), for a few months, so it's probably time for a bit of footage – perhaps in in <em>Superman</em>, or perhaps some early clips from her own movie is ready enough.</p><p>At the very least, I'd expect a costume reveal and some chat about the tone of that movie.</p>

<p>I'm expecting to see <em>Wuthering Heights</em> here today. The new adaptation is coming from <em>Saltburn</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em> director Emerald Fennell, and stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi.</p><p>It supposedly wrapped filming last month, so some kind of first-look reel seems likely, and will maybe give people a good glimpse into what kind of tone to expect. Fennell's movies are not exactly known for their bland approach to the topics they touch on…</p>
<p>Alright, five minutes to go, just enough time to hope that Kevin Costner's <em>Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2 </em>and<em> 3</em> get release dates and not just completely buried here, despite <em>Chapter 1</em> bombing horribly. Because we really need to let these visionaries cook, and I've heard very good things about <em>Chapter 2</em> from the few people who've seen it.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div>
<p>While we wait for things to actually start, you could check out the trailer for <em>Hurry Up Tomorrow</em>, mentioned earlier, in which The Weeknd is playing a version of himself, and Jenna Ortega plays a stranger who comes into his life and causes him to lose his mind.</p><p>And Barry Keoghan is playing the normal best friend, seemingly? I feel like <em>that</em> bit will turn out not to be true…</p>
<p>We are still waiting for things to properly start, but it appears that the stars and director of <em>Superman</em> are hanging around. Hm, I wonder if the movie that apparently the whole future of DC Studios has been staked on will feature heavily…</p>
<p>The New Line Cinema logo has appeared, which is attached to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>Dune</em> and (apparently the one I've really become hopeful for, for some reason) <em>Horizon</em> movies.</p><p>Not only those, of course, but I truly doubt we'll get away from this with none of these movies appearing.</p>
<p>In case you weren't aware that another LotR movie is in the works, it's called <em>The Hunt for Gollum</em>, and is set to be directed by Andy Serkis, featuring Gandalf heavily. It's been slated for a 2027 release, so a brief tease today is probably all we can hope for… not that all LotR fans would use the word 'hope' there, I suspect.</p>
<p>Imminent releases <em>Sinners</em> (from director Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan) and <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> (directed by Jared Hess of <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> fame, inexplicably, and starring Jack Black equally inexplicably) are getting some time in the sun before we move onto future events.</p>
