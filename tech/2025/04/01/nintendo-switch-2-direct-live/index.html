     <p>It's almost the big day gamers! The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is under 24 hours away and we're expecting to learn all about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p><p>From a potential breakdown of its unique hardware features to our first confirmation of some of its launch games, this is likely to be the most interesting and exciting Nintendo broadcasts in years.</p><p>So what do you we know for sure about the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct? Not a lot beyond its start time, length, and how to watch it, but that's exactly what makes it so intriguing.</p><p>Join me as I keep you up to date with all the latest news and rumors as they come in throughout the build up to the event. I'll also be sharing my own personal predictions, plus the occasional tip on how best to prepare.</p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-direct-start-time-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct start time</h3>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct takes place on April 2, 2025. It starts at <strong>9AM ET / 6AM PT / 2PM BST</strong>.</p><p>Nintendo has now confirmed via a social media post that the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct will be "approximately 60 minutes long" - which is about what we expected.</p>
<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-direct-live-countdown-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct live countdown</h3>
<p>Want to see the hours and minutes tick down in real time? Here's a live countdown to the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p>

<h3 id="nintendo-switch-2-direct-how-to-watch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct how to watch</h3>
<p>The most reliable place to watch the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is the official Nintendo YouTube channel. It will also be streaming via Twitch.</p><p>The broadcast is currently not live, so I'd recommend bookmarking the page for easy access. When you are able to tune in, I'll let you know straight away so keep checking back here for updates.</p>
<p>Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the beginning of our live Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct coverage!</p><p>With the highly anticipated event under 24 hours away, there's still plenty of time to get excited before our first in-depth look at Nintendo's next console.</p><p>Whether you're a more recent fan or a long time Nintendo gamer like me, nothing quite compares to the excitement of learning more about a new piece of hardware from the company.</p><p>Tomorrow's event is undoubtedly going to be an important part of gaming, so this isn't one that you'll want to miss!</p><p>I'm going to be guiding you through the build up to the broadcast, so let's begin...</p>
<h3 id="what-is-tomorrow-s-event-2">What is tomorrow's event?</h3>

<p>Don't worry if you're a little out of the loop and want to know what all the fuss is about. Here's a quick recap explaining exactly why we're so excited.</p><p>Nintendo first unveiled the Nintendo Switch 2, the upcoming successor to its hugely popular Nintendo Switch console, in a surprise reveal trailer posted almost two months ago on January 16, 2025.</p><p>It showed off the new system officially for the first time, with a slick 3D animation paired with cute music and cool sound effects.</p><p>Although there were plenty of small hints throughout, the video confirmed very few new features and didn't explicitly mention any games (though what looks like a new <em>Mario Kart </em>was shown briefly on screen).</p><p>It did plainly state that the Nintendo Switch 2 would be able to play most Nintendo Switch games though, but that's basically all we know for sure right now.</p><p>The video ended with a date: April 2, 2025, which the company then confirmed would be the day of a dedicated Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p><p>I expect this broadcast to be a detailed breakdown of the system, outlining its features and revealing some of its launch games. I also think we're likely to learn a release date, with pre-orders potentially opening too.</p>
<h3 id="nintendo-confirms-the-broadcast-s-length-2">Nintendo confirms the broadcast's length</h3>
<p>Here's a quick, but important, update!</p><p>Nintendo has officially confirmed the length of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct in a new X / Twitter post.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us tomorrow, April 2nd, at 6 a.m. PT for a closer look at #NintendoSwitch2! The #NintendoDirect: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025 livestream will be approximately 60 minutes long.Watch it here: https://t.co/Rw1wnp5Xbr pic.twitter.com/eF7jJ2dDxjApril 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We now know that it last around 60 minutes, which falls in line with my own predictions. That's a bit longer than the usual 40 minute or so Nintendo Direct format, so hopefully means that we're going learn a lot of new information.</p>
<p>Even if you've seen it before, I would recommend giving yourself a quick recap of the initial Nintendo Switch 2 first-look trailer to get yourself excited before tomorrow's event.</p><p>You can see it below:</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div>
<h3 id="what-new-features-will-we-see-2">What new features will we see?</h3>

<p>What kinds of interesting new features do I think will be shown in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct tomorrow? It's a big question, but I'm going to make a few predictions...</p><p>Firstly, I think we're definitely going to see the long-rumored mouse mode in action. This has been the subject of many leaks and was even hinted at by that console reveal trailer (which showed the Joy-Con darting around a flat surface like mice).</p><p>The idea is that the new Joy-Con controllers will be able to be used on their sides thanks to an optical sensor that lets them detect movements to control things on-screen.</p><p>It sounds a bit silly at first, but the practical applications of this idea could be huge. It would allow for much better precision in shooter games like Nintendo's own <em>Splatoon</em>, or be a blessing for navigating the complex interfaces of something like <em>Super Mario Maker.</em></p><p>I would also be money on the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct given us our first glimpse at the console's user interface and software features. Hopefully it's going to be a bit more exciting than the relatively plain Nintendo Switch UI. I've personally got my fingers crossed for the addition of colorful system themes.</p><p>Nintendo always shies away from talking in concrete numbers, but I do think the company will still find some way of showing us just how much more powerful the Nintendo Switch 2 is than its predecessor. Perhaps we'll see some of the more intensive Nintendo Switch running smoothly on the new machine...</p>
<h3 id="nintendo-hints-at-mouse-mode-again-2">Nintendo hints at mouse mode again</h3>

<p>Speaking of that rumored mouse mode, Nintendo seems to have hinted at it again!</p><p>If you launch the Nintendo Today app on your mobile phone right now, you'll be greeted by a brief teaser video showing the Nintendo Switch 2 in all its glory.</p><p>Look closely, and you'll notice that the video (which you can see a still from above) shows the right Joy-Con placed on its side, seeming suspiciously like a computer mouse... Very interesting indeed.</p>
<h3 id="the-mysterious-c-button-explained-2">The mysterious C button explained?</h3>

<p>Back to some predictions now.</p><p>I also think that we're going to learn what the mysterious 'C' button is all about. This strange input was conspicuously absent from the reveal trailer, replaced with a blank square, but has shown up repeatedly in leaks and even on some of Nintendo's own promotional images (whoops).</p><p>It seems almost certain that it's going to be present on the Nintendo Switch 2, but what could it actually do? I have some ideas.</p><p>My personal theory is that the 'C' stands for 'Control', and will allow the player to enable or disable the rumored mouse mode. To me this makes a lot of sense, but others have speculated that it could be tied to some new social features which could be pretty cool. Miiverse 2, anyone?</p><p>That said these are just guesses and the only way we're going to find out what it's for is by waiting for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct and keeping our fingers crossed for some more info.</p>

<p>Here's one good way to prepare for the broadcast.</p><p>Right now if you head over to this page on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel, you can click a button in the bottom left hand corner of the video player to receive a notification when the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct goes live.</p><p>This will help ensure that won't miss it on the day. Just bear in mind that you will need to be logged in with a YouTube channel in order for the option to appear.</p>
<h3 id="treehouse-live-could-offer-some-valuable-insight-2">Treehouse: Live could offer some valuable insight</h3>

<p>Nintendo has confirmed two new Nintendo Treehouse: Live streams after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. The first will take place on April 3, with the second following on April 4.</p><p>Both will kick off at 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 2PM BST and give us a live hands-on look at some Nintendo Switch 2 games in action.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on April 3rd and April 4th at 7 a.m. PT each day for a Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2 presentation featuring hands-on gameplay of #NintendoSwitch2 games! pic.twitter.com/gsi0MqyZyZApril 1, 2025</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>If you're not familiar with Nintendo Treehouse Live, the format has been used by the company frequently in the past. It basically involves a room filled with various presenters, who you watch play with some of the latest hardware and/or games.</p><p>These two streams could prove very insightful, giving us a relatively unfiltered look at the Nintendo Switch 2 in action, so definitely tune in if you get the chance.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-of-trading-in-your-og-switch-2">Thinking of trading in your OG Switch?</h3>

<p>Here's an interesting little titbit to consider.</p><p>Apparently, a leaked brochure from Gamestop has revealed the retailer's trade-in plans ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p><p>An image of it was posted to X / Twitter, which stated that owners of an older Nintendo Switch system would be able to "get up to $175" towards the Nintendo Switch 2 by trading it in.</p><p>Those with a Nintendo Switch OLED would get the full $175 - with $125 and $100 offered for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite respectively. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any mention of the Nintendo Switch 2's price point on everything that I've seen so we're still in the dark on that point for now.</p><p>All things considered, this still looks like a pretty good deal though and could really help soften the financial blow if you're looking to upgrade.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-the-price-2">But what about the price?</h3>

<p>For many people, I think lots of the appeal of the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to depend heavily on its price point.</p><p>Annoyingly, the price is one of the things we know the absolute least about which makes it a little bit tricky to talk about.</p><p>Our in-house prediction (and what I personally think is the most likely) is that it will come to $399.99 / £349.99 / AU$699.95.</p><p>This would be a step up from the $349.99 / £309.99 / AU$539.95 asking price of the Nintendo Switch OLED, expected given the almost undoubtedly improved specs this time around, but still undercut Nintendo's biggest competitors given the higher cost of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p><p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa did discuss the price point of the Nintendo Switch 2 in an investor Q&A back in February. He said that it will fall in line with the "affordable prices customers expect" - so hopefully we're not looking at anything much higher than the $400 mark / £350 / AU$ 700 .</p>
<h3 id="will-we-even-see-a-us-price-2">Will we even see a US price?</h3>
<p>Given the evolving situation surrounding potential tariffs in the US, there's also been some discussion as to whether we will even see a US price at all tomorrow.</p><p>After all, it seems reasonable to assume that Nintendo wouldn't want to announce a price point for a product only for it to end up costing much more when it hits shelves.</p><p>It's a possibility that, while other regions will see one announced, the US Price could be left up in the air.</p><p>What would this mean for retailers? Rather than traditional pre-orders, I think in this situation US retailers could opt to offer refundable deposits - going towards a final price that is announced closer to the product's launch.</p><p>This would also explain why that leaked material from Gamestop didn't mention a price at all.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-4k-support-2">What about 4K support?</h3>

<p>The latest Nintendo Switch 2 rumor has cast some doubt on the idea that the console will support 4K video output.</p><p>Allegedly, some developers have already received Nintendo Switch 2 development kits and noticed that they don't support 4K video output.</p><p>This would indicate that it won't be supported on the finished product either, but do consider that development kits can often have different specs and features than the consoles that they're for.</p><p>This is just a rumor for the time being, however, so you should take it with a mountain of salt.</p><p>We'll likely find out for sure tomorrow.</p>
