<p>Windows 11 does a lot under the hood to speed up a PC’s performance. The same PC will generally run faster on Windows 11 than Windows 10. But no matter how zippy your Windows 11 may be, it can run faster. And keep in mind that PCs tend to slow down over time, and you want to make sure that doesn’t happen to yours.</p>



<p>It’s simple to make your Windows PC run faster. Just follow these tips.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-ways-to-speed-up-windows-11">Top ways to speed up Windows 11</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Disable programs that run on startup</li>



<li>Use efficiency mode</li>



<li>Use automatic Windows maintenance</li>



<li>Kill adware and bloatware</li>



<li>Turn off search indexing</li>



<li>Clean out your hard disk</li>



<li>Disable shadows, animations, and visual effects</li>



<li>Disable transparency</li>



<li>Change your power settings</li>



<li>Turn off Windows tips and tricks</li>



<li>Disable Game Mode</li>



<li>Update device drivers</li>



<li>Get a burst of RAM with ReadyBoost</li>



<li>Roll back your PC to a previous state</li>



<li>Restart Windows</li>
</ul>



<p>Read on for details.</p>



<p><em>Note: This story covers Windows 11 version 24H2. If you have an earlier release of Windows 11, some things may be slightly different. If you have Windows 10, see our Windows 10 speed tips.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-disable-programs-that-run-on-startup">1. Disable programs that run on startup</h3>



<p>Your Windows 11 PC could be a laggard if programs you rarely or never use are running in the background. Your PC will run faster if you stop them from running.</p>



<p>To do it, first launch the Task Manager in one of these ways: Press <em>Ctrl-Shift-Esc</em>, right-click the lower-right corner of your screen and select <em>Task Manager</em>, or type <strong>task manager</strong> into the Windows 11 search box and press <em>Enter</em>. There’s a lot you can use Task Manager for, but here we’re focusing only on killing unnecessary programs that run at startup.</p>



<p>Click the <em>Startup apps</em> icon on the left side of the screen. (It’s the fifth icon from the top.) It displays a list of the programs and services that launch when you start Windows. The list includes each program’s name as well as its publisher, whether it’s enabled to run on startup, and its “Startup impact,” which is how much it slows down Windows 11 when the system starts up. Note, though, that the screen doesn’t show how much each program will impact your performance after startup, during normal PC operations.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>You can use the Task Manager to get information about programs that launch at startup and disable any you don’t need.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<p>To stop a program or service from launching at startup, right-click it and select <em>Disable</em>. This doesn’t disable the program entirely; it only prevents it from launching at startup — you can run the application after launch. Also, if you later decide you want it to launch at startup, you can return to this area of the Task Manager, right-click the application and select <em>Enable</em>.</p>



<p>Many of the programs and services that run on startup may be familiar to you, like Microsoft OneDrive or Spotify. But you may not recognize many of them. (Anyone who immediately knows what “bzbui.exe” is, please raise your hand. No fair Googling it first.)</p>



<p>The Task Manager can find information about unfamiliar programs. Right-click an item and select <em>Properties</em> for more information about it, including its location on your hard disk, whether it has a digital signature, and other information such as the version number, the file size, and the last time it was modified. (Note that not all programs provide this information when you right-click them — the Properties button may be grayed out.)</p>



<p>You can also right-click the item and select <em>Open file location</em>. That opens File Explorer and takes it to the folder where the file is located, which may give you another clue about the program’s purpose.</p>



<p>Finally, and most helpfully, you can select <em>Search online</em> after you right-click. Bing will then launch with links to sites with information about the program or service. With Task Manager’s help, I easily discovered that bzbui.exe is Backblaze backup software, something I want to run automatically during startup.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about one of the listed applications, you can go to a site run by Reason Software called “Should I Block It?” and search for the file name. You’ll usually find very solid information about the program or service.</p>



<p>Now that you’ve selected all the programs that you want to disable at startup, the next time you restart your computer, the system won’t launch those unnecessary programs automatically, and your PC may run faster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-use-efficiency-mode">2. Use Efficiency Mode</h3>



<p>Task Manager has another trick up its sleeve for juicing Windows 11 performance. Efficiency Mode can speed up your PC and improve laptop battery life. It lowers the process priority of background applications, among other efficiency tricks.</p>



<p>The term is a bit of a misnomer, because you can’t put your entire PC into Efficiency Mode. Instead, you use Task Manager to put individual apps and processes into it. There’s one caveat: You’ll only be able to use it on some apps and processes.</p>



<p>First launch Task Manager using one of the methods covered in the previous tip. If you’re already in Task Manager, click the <em>Processes</em> icon (three squares in a grid) on the left side of the screen to get to the Processes screen. A list of currently running apps and processes appears.</p>



<p>Click the app or process you want to put into Efficiency Mode, click the <em>Efficiency mode</em> icon at the top right of the screen, then confirm that you want to turn on Efficiency Mode for the app. Note that if the Efficiency mode icon is grayed out when you click an app or process, you won’t be able to use it. Also, some apps, including Microsoft Edge, automatically work in Efficiency Mode by default, and the mode can’t be turned off.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-use-automatic-windows-maintenance">3. Use automatic Windows maintenance</h3>



<p>In the background, Windows 11 constantly performs maintenance on your PC, doing things like security scanning and performing system diagnostics to make sure everything is up to snuff. It automatically fixes problems it finds, which helps your PC run at peak performance. The automatic maintenance runs every day at 2:00 a.m. if your device is plugged into a power source and is asleep.</p>



<p>However, that feature may have been accidentally turned off, or it may not have run recently if you shut down your PC at night (rather than putting it in Sleep mode) or you haven’t had your laptop plugged in for a while. You should make sure it’s turned on and runs every day. You can also run it manually if you’d like.</p>



<p>Type <strong>control</strong> in the search box on the taskbar and select <em>Control Panel</em> from the results to run the Control Panel app. In the app, select <em>System and Security > Security and Maintenance</em>. In the Maintenance section, under Automatic Maintenance, click <em>Start maintenance</em> if you want it to run now. To make sure that it runs every day, click <em>Change maintenance settings</em>, and on the screen that appears, select the time you’d like maintenance to run and check the box next to <em>Allow scheduled maintenance to wake up my computer at the scheduled time</em>. Then click <em>OK</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Here’s how to set a time each day for Windows 11 to run its maintenance tasks.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-kill-adware-and-bloatware">4. Kill adware and bloatware</h3>



<p>It may be that what’s slowing your PC down isn’t Windows 11, but bloatware or adware that takes up CPU and system resources. Adware and bloatware are particularly insidious because they may have been installed by your computer’s manufacturer. They typically run automatically at startup without you even knowing it. You’ll be amazed at how much better your PC will run if you get rid of it.</p>



<p>Start by running a system scan to find adware and malware. If you’ve already installed a security suite such as Norton Security or McAfee LiveSafe, you can use that. Windows 11’s built-in anti-malware app, Windows Defender, also does a great job. Just type <strong>windows defender</strong> in the search box, press <em>Enter</em>, and click <em>Scan Now</em>. Windows Defender will look for malware and remove any it finds.</p>



<p>You should get a second opinion, though, so consider a free tool like Malwarebytes. The free version scans for malware and adware and removes what it finds; the paid version offers always-on protection to stop infections in the first place.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Malwarebytes scans for and removes malware.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Now that you’ve done all that, check for bloatware and uninstall it. A good free anti-bloatware tool is Bulk Crap Uninstaller. You can also go to the website Should I Remove It? — it offers recommendations on what software is useful, and what you can uninstall. There’s a section of the website devoted to advice on how to remove bloatware on PCs from specific manufacturers. I highly recommend going there, because it lists all the bloatware different manufacturers install on their PCs. That section of the site also compares how much bloatware major manufacturers ship on their PCs. It rates Toshiba as having the most and Acer as having the least.</p>



<p>Finally, when you buy a new PC online, check whether there’s an option to leave off trial software and software you don’t need to run your PC. That will stop bloatware from getting on your system in the first place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-turn-off-search-indexing">5. Turn off search indexing</h3>



<p>Windows 11 search performs indexing in your hard disk in the background, allowing you to search your PC more quickly than if no indexing were being done. That’s good for fast searches, but not so good for slower PCs, because indexing can cause a performance hit. You can give a slower machine a speed boost by turning off indexing. Even if you have an SSD disk, turning off indexing can improve your speed, because the constant writing to disk that indexing does can eventually slow down SSDs.</p>



<p>To turn it off, type <strong>services.msc</strong> into the search box on the taskbar and press <em>Enter</em>. The Services app appears. Scroll down to either Indexing Service or Windows Search in the list of services. Double-click it, and on the screen that appears, click <em>Stop</em>. Then reboot your machine. Your searches may be slightly slower, but you also may not notice the difference. You should, though, get an overall speed boost.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Here’s how to turn off Windows 11 indexing.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<p>Alternatively, you can turn off indexing only for files in certain locations. In this way, you can still index files and folders you often search for but turn off indexing for the rest of your hard disk. So you’d still get fast searches for files you use often, while increasing your PC’s performance.</p>



<p>To do it, type <strong>index</strong> in the Windows 11 search box and click the <em>Indexing Options</em> result that appears. The Indexing Options page of the Control Panel appears. Click the <em>Modify</em> button, and you’ll see a list of locations that are being indexed, such as Microsoft Outlook, your personal files, and so on. Uncheck the box next to any location, and it will no longer be indexed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-clean-out-your-hard-disk">6. Clean out your hard disk</h3>



<p>A bloated hard disk filled with files you don’t need can slow down your PC. Taking a few minutes to clean it can give an immediate speed boost. A built-in Windows 11 tool called Storage Sense will do the job for you.</p>



<p>Launch the Settings app, select <em>Storage</em>, scroll down to the “Storage management” section, and next to Storage Sense, move the toggle from Off to On. From now on, Windows will constantly monitor your PC and delete old junk files you no longer need — temporary files, files in the Downloads folder that haven’t been changed in a month, and old Recycle Bin files.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Here’s where to customize the way Storage Sense works.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<p>You can also customize when Storage Sense runs and what should be deleted automatically — for example, whether to delete files from the Downloads folder after they’ve been there for more than 30 days. To do it, click the right-facing arrow next to the Storage Sense On/Off slider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-disable-shadows-animations-and-visual-effects">7. Disable shadows, animations, and visual effects</h3>



<p>Those who like eye candy are probably big fans of Windows 11’s shadows, animations, and visual effects. They typically don’t affect performance on fast, newer PCs. But they can exact a performance hit on older, slower machines.</p>



<p>If you’ve got a slower PC, turn them off. To do it, in the Windows 11 search box, type <strong>sysdm.cpl</strong>, press <em>Enter</em>, and then click the <em>sysdm.cpl </em>icon. That launches the Control Panel’s System Properties dialog box. Click the <em>Advanced</em> tab and click <em>Settings</em> in the Performance section. That brings you to the Performance Options dialog box. (Make sure you’re on the Visual Effects tab of the dialog box.) You’ll see a varied list of animations and special effects.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>The Performance Options dialog box lets you turn off visual effects that might be slowing down Windows 11.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you love to tweak, you can turn individual options on and off. These are the animations and special effects you’ll probably want to turn off, because they have the greatest effect on system performance:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Animate controls and elements inside windows</li>



<li>Animate windows when minimizing and maximizing</li>



<li>Animations in the taskbar</li>



<li>Fade or slide menus into view</li>



<li>Fade or slide ToolTips into view</li>



<li>Fade out menu items after clicking</li>



<li>Show shadows under windows</li>
</ul>



<p>However, it’s a lot easier to just select the <em>Adjust for best performance</em> option at the top of the screen and click <em>OK</em>. Windows 11 will then turn off the effects that slow down your system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-disable-transparency">8. Disable transparency</h3>



<p>To get an even bigger speed boost, go beyond turning off shadows, animations, and visual effects. Also disable the transparency effects in the taskbar and other Windows 11 locations. Windows does a surprising amount of heavy lifting to create transparency effects, and turning them off can make a difference in system performance.</p>



<p>To do it, run the Settings app and select<em> Personalization > Colors</em>, then move the <em>Transparency effects</em> slider to <em>Off</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Turning off Windows 11’s transparency effects can help speed up performance.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-change-your-power-settings">9. Change your power settings</h3>



<p>Your Windows 11 PC’s power settings let you balance its energy use with its performance. If you’re using the most power-efficient setting,  you’re slowing down your PC, because the setting reduces your PC’s performance to save energy. (Even desktop PCs typically have a power-saving setting.) Changing your power setting to one of the less power-efficient options will give you an instant performance boost.</p>



<p>To do it, run the Settings app, then choose <em>System</em> and click the right-facing arrow next to <em>Power</em>. Depending on whether you’re using a laptop or a desktop PC (and if you’re using a laptop, whether it’s plugged in), you’ll see either a “Plugged in” or “On battery” setting that lists the power mode you’re using. Click the drop-down arrow next to it and choose the setting you want.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<p><em>Best Performance</em> gives you the most oomph but uses the most power. <em>Balanced</em> finds a happy medium between power use and better performance, and <em>Best Power Efficiency</em> does everything it can to give you as much battery life as possible. Desktop users have no reason to choose Best Power Efficiency, and even laptop users should consider the Balanced option when unplugged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-turn-off-windows-tips-and-tricks">10. Turn off Windows tips and tricks</h3>



<p>Windows 11 constantly watches what you’re doing on your PC and gives you tips about things you might want to do with the operating system. I’ve never found these tips helpful. And I don’t like the privacy implications of Windows constantly taking a virtual look over my shoulder.</p>



<p>Beyond that, this monitoring can also make your PC run more sluggishly. So to speed things up, tell Windows to stop being so nosy and giving you advice. To do it, run the Settings app and select <em>System > Notifications</em>. Scroll down to <em>Additional settings</em> and click the down arrow. From the options that appear, uncheck the box marked <em>Get tips and suggestions when using Windows</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Turn off Windows’ suggestions to help things run more smoothly (and regain a measure of privacy).</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-disable-game-mode">11. Disable Game Mode</h3>



<p>Windows 11’s Game Mode optimizes your PC for playing games. When it detects that you’re playing a game, it prioritizes system resources for gaming, taking them away from other apps and background processes. That’s great for serious gamers, but when you’re not playing games, it can slow down your system because it keeps some system resources in reserve in case you start playing a game. It occasionally causes stability issues as well. So turning off Game Mode may be able to give your PC a quick boost. (You can always turn it back on again when you want to play a game.)</p>



<p>Game Mode is turned on by default, so even if you’ve never played a game on your PC, it’s probably enabled. To turn it off, go to <em>Settings > Gaming > Game Mode</em> and move the Game Mode slider to <em>Off</em>.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Game Mode can sometimes cause stability and performance issues, so turning it off may give your PC a boost.</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Preston Gralla / Foundry</p></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-update-device-drivers">12. Update device drivers</h3>



<p>Your Windows 11 PC can become a slowpoke if its drivers are old and in the way. Outdated drivers can exact a big performance hit. Graphics drivers are often the biggest culprit in driver-related slowdowns. To check whether yours is outdated, and to update to the latest one:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>In the Windows search box, type <strong>device manager</strong>, and click on the <em>Device Manager</em> icon that appears.</li>



<li>Scroll to the Display Adapters entry and click the side-facing arrow to expand it.</li>



<li>Right-click the driver, and from the context menu that appears, select <em>Update Driver</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>You’ll be asked whether to have Windows search for an updated driver, or whether you want to find one and install it manually. Your best bet is to let Windows do the work. Follow the on-screen instructions to get the driver installed.</p>



<p>You can use the Device Manager to update all your drivers this way. That’s time-consuming, so consider asking Windows to do the work for you. To do it, launch the Settings app (pressing the Windows key + I is a good shortcut for doing it) and select <em>Windows Update</em> from the left pane.  Select <em>Advanced Options > Optional Updates</em>. You’ll see a list of all the updates Windows has found but hasn’t installed. Select any of the drivers you want to install, then click <em>Download & install</em>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-get-a-burst-of-ram-with-readyboost">13. Get a burst of RAM with ReadyBoost</h3>



<p>If you’ve got a sluggish PC, the issue may be that you haven’t got enough RAM. One solution is to add more RAM to it, but that can be a daunting task if you’re not comfortable opening up your computer and fussing around with its innards, or if you’ve got a laptop whose RAM can’t be added to.</p>



<p>For a simple, easy-to-use low-cost solution, turn to the Windows 11 feature ReadyBoost, which uses a USB flash drive to essentially boost your RAM by caching data on it. Make sure the flash drive you buy has at least 500MB free and has a minimum data transfer rate of 3.5 MB/s for 4KB random reads and 2.5 MB/s for 512KB random writes. The flash drive needs to be USB 2.0 or above, as does the slot into which you’ll insert it.</p>



<p>To do it:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Put the flash drive into a free slot.</li>



<li>Right-click it in File Explorer and select <em>Properties</em>.</li>



<li>From the screen that appears, select <em>ReadyBoost > Use this device</em>.</li>



<li>Click <em>OK</em>, then <em>Apply</em>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Note that if Windows is installed on a solid state drive (SSD), you won’t be able to use ReadyBoost, because SSDs are fast, and Windows will already be using it as a cache to boost performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-roll-back-your-pc-to-a-previous-state">14. Roll back your PC to a previous state</h3>



<p>Sometimes your PC will slow down for no apparent reason, and stay slow. It could be a new driver slowing your system down. Perhaps accidentally you changed a system setting that caused the problem. It can be difficult, and often impossible, to get to the root of these kinds of problems and fix them.</p>



<p>If you’ve noticed that your computer has become sluggish recently, there’s something that might solve the issue: Restore your PC to the state it was in before the problem began. You can easily do this via System Restore.</p>



<p>To do it:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Type <strong>advanced system </strong>into the search box on the taskbar and click the <em>View advanced system settings</em> icon that appears.</li>



<li>From the screen that appears, select <em>System Protection > System Restore</em>.</li>



<li>On the screen that appears, select <em>Recommended restore</em> and click <em>Next</em> if you want to revert to the most recent restore point. Select <em>Choose a different restore point</em> if you want to choose one yourself, and click <em>Next</em>.</li>



<li>Restart your PC. It will revert to its previous state. Note that when you do this, your documents, pictures, and personal data won’t be deleted.</li>
</ol>



<p>If System Restore hasn’t already been turned on for your system, you won’t be able to revert to a previous restore point. It’s easy to turn on if you want to use it in the future, though.</p>



<p>Go to the System Protection screen as outlined above, and click <em>Configure</em>. Select <em>Turn on system protection</em> and click <em>OK</em>. From then on, your PC will regularly create restore points. If you want to create one right away, back on the System Protection screen, click <em>Create</em>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-restart-windows">15. Restart Windows</h3>



<p>Here’s one of IT’s not-quite-secret weapons for troubleshooting and speeding up a PC: shut it down and restart it. Doing that clears out any excess use of RAM that otherwise can’t be cleared. It also kills processes that you might have set in motion and are no longer needed, but that continue running and slow your system.</p>



<p>If your Windows 11 PC has turned sluggish over time for no apparent reason, you may be surprised at how much more quickly it will run when you do this. I can vouch for it, and I restart my Windows 11 PCs regularly even if they’re not sluggish, just as a precautionary measure.</p>
