<p>Digi Yatra, a mobile-based platform that uses facial recognition technology to make air travel more seamless and secure, was developed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA) and the Digi Yatra Foundation. The foundation’s flagship initiative, the Digi Yatra Service, leverages a decentralized ecosystem built on Self-Sovereign Identity and Single Token face biometric technology to deliver a seamless and hassle-free travel experience. Suresh Khadakbhavi, CEO, Digi Yatra Foundation talks in detail on the ongoing journey of Digi Yatra in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-what-are-the-three-megatrends-technology-and-or-business-that-will-impact-the-future-of-digiyatra-and-its-importance-for-the-industry">Q. What are the three megatrends (technology and/or business) that will impact the future of DigiYatra and its importance for the industry?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> AI is transforming every industry. As more travelers prioritize safety and privacy, AI is playing a crucial role in enhancing security measures. Technologies like live detection and anti-spoofing are evolving rapidly to prevent fraud and ensure seamless travel experiences. At Digi Yatra, we recognize AI’s potential and are implementing it in our services. We are in the process of developing multilingual AI chatbots to assist passengers with onboarding and credential management. Beyond AI, we are integrating verified credentials (VCs) created from passports and driving licenses. We are also exploring partnerships with airlines and OTAs to streamline boarding pass sharing directly from their apps. We plan to make our SDK (Software Development Kit)/ ecosystem available for other industries with manual verification, such as hotels. These initiatives will make Digi Yatra a key player in the future of seamless and secure travel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-self-sovereign-identity-is-a-digital-identity-model-that-allows-users-to-control-their-online-information-how-do-you-think-this-will-empower-travelers-and-transform-air-travel">Q. Self-sovereign identity is a digital identity model that allows users to control their online information. How do you think this will empower travelers and transform air travel?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> Self-sovereign identity is offering passengers greater control over their personal data while ensuring a seamless journey. Digi Yatra app eliminates the need for physical documents, allowing travelers to move through airport touchpoints using facial biometric technology. So, instead of presenting a government-issued ID and a boarding pass separately, passengers authenticate their identity once through the app, streamlining the verification process. This approach reduces wait times, enhances security, and minimizes the risk of document loss.</p>



<p>With over 11 million downloads and 48 million users across 24 airports, Digi Yatra is one of the largest successful implementations of decentralized identity. The platform ensures privacy through a self-sovereign model where personal information remains securely stored on the user’s device, making it faster, safer, and more efficient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-does-self-sovereign-identity-use-blockchain-technology-for-certificates-and-digital-signatures-on-the-vc-do-you-feel-blockchain-will-become-more-mainstream-in-india-and-move-beyond-early-adopter-v">Q. Does self-sovereign identity use blockchain technology for certificates and digital signatures on the VC? Do you feel blockchain will become more mainstream in India and move beyond early adopter verticals like BFSI, Travel, etc.?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> Yes, self-sovereign identity (SSI) often leverages blockchain technology for certificates and digital signatures on Verifiable Credentials (VC). Blockchain provides a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital identities and credentials. This approach enhances security and gives individuals full control over their personal data without relying on centralized authorities.</p>



<p>In India, blockchain technology has entered areas like retail, healthcare, telecommunications, and the public sector. The government’s exploration of blockchain applications in land records management, supply chain transparency, and educational credentialing reflects this broader integration. However, challenges like scalability, regulatory compliance, and interoperability persist, hindering widespread adoption. With ongoing advancements and regulatory support, we can expect to see broader adoption of blockchain technology beyond early adopter verticals like BFSI and Travel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-what-is-the-next-wave-of-ai-and-gen-ai-in-indian-companies-and-how-will-cios-and-tech-leaders-of-companies-stay-prepared-for-it-do-you-see-faster-adoption-and-implementation-of-ai-and-gen-ai-in-d">Q. What is the next wave of AI and Gen AI in Indian companies, and how will CIOs and tech leaders of companies stay prepared for it? Do you see faster adoption and implementation of AI and Gen AI in dynamic B2C industries like airlines and travel?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> The ongoing tech transformation needs a proactive approach. I believe developing proprietary language models tailored to specific business needs can reduce reliance on external providers, mitigating geopolitical risks. Robust data governance frameworks are also crucial for the foundation for effective AI implementation. Moreover, investing in upskilling initiatives will equip teams with the necessary skills to manage and innovate with AI technologies. AI and Generative AI are rapidly enhancing efficiency and customer experience in B2C industries like airlines and travel. Digi Yatra is leading this evolution, deploying AI-powered facial biometric technology to streamline passenger verification and reduce wait times at airport touchpoints. AI-driven multilingual chatbots are being integrated to assist travelers with onboarding and real-time support. As Digi Yatra expands, AI will play a key role in document verification and fraud prevention, simplifying international travel processes. These advancements will create a seamless, contactless, and privacy-first journey for passengers, reinforcing Digi Yatra’s commitment to innovation and operational excellence in air travel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-the-facial-recognition-technology-based-check-in-service-at-airports-called-digi-yatra-could-be-implemented-at-hotels-and-public-places-like-historical-monuments-according-to-digi-yatra-foundati">Q. The facial-recognition technology-based check-in service at airports, called Digi Yatra, could be implemented at hotels and public places like historical monuments, according to Digi Yatra Foundation. Has there been a prototype for this use-case developed and discussions ongoing with various government agencies such as the Ministry of Tourism?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> Digi Yatra’s contactless biometric solutions have the potential to extend beyond airports, supporting a more integrated and secure travel ecosystem across India. While the platform is currently under enhancements at airports with additional e-gates at various touchpoints to ensure smoother passenger flow, its application can be explored in other sectors where identity validation is essential.</p>



<p>By integrating Digi Yatra across multiple travel and public spaces, India can establish a tech-driven, globally benchmarked travel ecosystem that is efficient, secure, and traveler-friendly. For travelers, it would mean a hassle-free travel experience across the board. For the travel industry, integrating Digi Yatra can drive greater operational efficiency by automating ID checks and reducing manual verification processes, making the whole end to end experience much more satisfying for the end customers. The government and tourism ministry can leverage this to ensure security and a seamless travel experience. With data-driven insights, they can plan infrastructure, allocate resources efficiently, and improve overall travel management.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-customer-experience-is-the-new-king-as-the-technology-products-put-the-customers-at-the-center-of-their-design-how-do-you-intend-to-leverage-ai-and-gen-ai-further-and-also-keep-growing-cyberattac">Q. Customer experience is the new king as the technology products put the customers at the center of their design. How do you intend to leverage AI and Gen AI further, and also keep growing cyberattacks (traditional and AI-based) at bay?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> Customer experience is paramount today, with technological solutions designed with the user at the centre. Digi Yatra operates on a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework, utilizing blockchain and face authentication technology to provide a secure, paperless, and hassle-free travel experience. When a user registers, their mobile number is verified and facial data is retrieved from Aadhaar, which is then matched with the selfie face to ensure that there is no misuse. Instead of storing personal data centrally, the ID credentials are only stored in the user’s smart phone in a secure wallet, a unique hash value is also generated from the user’s credentials. This hash is securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and to check for any tampering of the user’s credentials.</p>



<p>Our Privacy by Design (PbD) principles and decentralized storage model significantly enhance security, minimizing the risk of data breaches, identity theft, or unauthorized access. Passenger data remains solely on the user’s mobile device, giving travelers full control over their credentials. Additionally, Digi Yatra follows a strict data retention policy, ensuring that any shared information to the Airport verifiers is automatically purged within 24 hours of the Scheduled time of departure of the flight, reinforcing our commitment to data privacy and minimal data exposure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-how-do-you-see-digi-yatra-evolve-into-by-the-year-2026-what-would-you-like-digi-yatra-to-be-known-as-in-the-industry">Q. How do you see Digi Yatra evolve into by the year 2026? What would you like Digi Yatra to be known as in the industry?</h3>



<p><strong>Suresh:</strong> We have a vision for Digi Yatra to be known as the ‘Travel stack of India’, providing a secure and private way to validate your identity for the purpose of physical or digital access or access to any services. We would also like to enable the next phase of our journey enabling International end to end seamless travel and to make the app available for Indian and Global citizens. We are working with IATA, ICAO and other ministries to make this dream come true. If we succeed in this, border crossings in India and other countries will become as seamless as the domestic process currently offered by Digi Yatra!</p>
