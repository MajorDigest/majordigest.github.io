<p>Having led a tech company for more than 20 years now, I often get asked one question: “What does it take to be a truly effective leader?”</p>



<p>It’s a question that has stayed the same over the years, even as my answer has evolved.</p>



<p>Twenty years ago, leadership was all about strategic thinking and decision-making. Then came the era of servant leadership, where empowering and inspiring teams became paramount. For a long period, leadership across industries celebrated this head-heart model, balancing rational and emotional intelligence. But given the pace at which the transformation has happened in the last two decades, this model is slowly falling apart.</p>



<p>With the grand entry of AI in all our lives, reshaping entire industries, we can see that the most successful leaders today, from Sam Altman to Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg, succeed not just because they think strategically or inspire their teams, but because they roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p>



<p>It’s becoming clear that success today requires not just head and heart, but hands as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-ai-experiment-that-fizzled">The AI experiment that fizzled</h3>



<p>Last January, I sent out a company-wide memo: “All teams are now authorized to experiment with AI tools. Find ways to boost productivity and report back.”</p>



<p>The initial response was quite enthusiastic. Department heads and managers scheduled training programs, procurement approved the subscription and discussion channels got oversaturated with documents on tips and tricks to use AI better.</p>



<p>Three months later, however, our progress and productivity dashboards were flat.</p>



<p>All department leads walked me through their comprehensive strategies for AI adoption: engineering built AI sandboxes, marketing trained models on our brand guidelines, and operations created hybrid human-AI workflows.</p>



<p>Everything looked perfect on paper. Yet our results hadn’t improved. We had done everything by the book — but we weren’t getting the outcomes we expected.</p>



<p>Turning to the mighty internet for an answer, I found the issue wasn’t effort or enthusiasm. Many companies were facing challenges in implementing AI. McKinsey’s 2024 State of AI Report noted that while AI adoption had grown sharply across industries compared to the previous year, the percentage of companies struggling with AI was still at around 70%.</p>



<p>So what, exactly, was missing?</p>



<p>The problem became clear when I started digging into the specifics. Our leaders had approached this challenge exactly as they’d been trained to — with strategic thinking (head) and genuine care for empowering their teams (heart).</p>



<p>Teams were layering AI tools on existing processes without understanding how the technology actually fit together. The outputs weren’t wrong; they were just inconsistent with our broader objectives.</p>



<p>I changed the approach by asking managers and leads to get their hands involved, too. Within weeks of developing this hands-on AI literacy, everything shifted. Instead of blindly incentivizing AI-amplified output, we started measuring what actually mattered: quality improvements, innovative experiments and time freed up for strategic thinking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Head + heart are necessary — but not sufficient</h3>



<p>The traditional understanding of a leader’s job has long been confined to head and heart, i.e., strategy and empowerment. Strategic and operational decisions shape the goals and objectives and hence the respective day-to-day work of an employee.</p>



<p>For years, head-first leadership meant leaders could rely on expert advisors to translate technical complexity into business insights. Later, heart-first leadership came along, which meant inspiring teams with autonomy, resources and encouragement, trusting they would find their own solutions.</p>



<p>These models still matter deeply. The continuous change that businesses face every day has made strategic judgment all the more important. Every year brings new technologies or market trends that force leaders to pivot. The head — the ability to synthesize complexity, weigh trade-offs and decide the direction — remains the foundational job role of leadership.</p>



<p>Similarly, the heart has never been more essential. Teams going through frequent disruption need emotional stability, credible guidance and a sense that their leaders understand the complexity of challenges. The empathy, inspiration and people development skills that define heart-centered leadership are crucial for helping organizations manage such change.</p>



<p>But AI disrupts this traditional playbook in ways that previous technological shifts never did.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-ai-is-redefining-leadership">How AI is redefining leadership</h3>



<p>Unlike past innovations that typically transformed specific processes or industries over predictable timelines, AI operates as what I call a “meta-technology.” It doesn’t just change how we work; it changes how we think about work itself. However, by nature, it creates a dangerous knowledge gap. Leaders find themselves making strategic bets on technology they don’t fundamentally understand, guided by experts who themselves are often learning in real time.</p>



<p>Leaders can’t simply analyze AI’s market impact or competitive implications because AI continuously evolves its own capabilities. The strategic landscape here is being rewritten by algorithms whose decision-making processes remain opaque even to their creators. This creates another layer of ambiguity and unprecedented challenge for strategic leadership.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How do you make informed technology decisions that learns and changes behavior independently?</li>



<li>How do you assess risks when the technology’s failure modes aren’t fully understood?</li>



<li>How do you plan resource allocation when AI’s impact on different business functions remains highly unpredictable?</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, teams facing AI transformation need leaders who can build confidence during learning curves and maintain human connection amid increasing automation. They can quickly recognize when leaders speak in abstractions rather than from lived experience. The inspirational language that worked for previous organizational changes — “trust the process,” “embrace the learning curve” — rings hollow when leaders haven’t walked that learning curve themselves.</p>



<p>Perhaps most critically, AI failures test leadership credibility in unprecedented ways. When traditional initiatives struggle, experienced leaders can coach teams through obstacles because they understand the underlying challenges. But when AI implementations produce unexpected results, hallucinate information or create workflow disruptions, leaders without hands-on experience find themselves unable to troubleshoot alongside their teams.</p>



<p>When leaders rely solely on head and heart, they inevitably create broad directives that sound strategic but lack operational specificity. This is what happened with us at ProofHub when we gave teams clear empowerment (“full autonomy”) and strategic direction, but the expectations remained fundamentally vague because we didn’t understand the technology well enough to provide concrete guidance.</p>



<p>Teams interpreted my directive as “nice to try” rather than “essential to master” precisely because my own engagement signaled it was optional rather than critical.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>What ‘hand-first’ actually means</h3>



<p>The hand-first leadership is all about managing by getting involved in the action. In other words, it can be understood as innovating as you execute. Hand leadership isn’t about micromanaging or abandoning strategy. It’s about leaders developing enough operational fluency with new technologies to bridge the gap between strategic vision and practical implementation.</p>



<p>The most comfortable, yet unfortunate, myth in technological shift is believing you can effectively guide adoption through high-level conceptual understanding alone. AI doesn’t play by that rule. It is not a technology that can be managed from a slide deck or a conference room. So we created a hands-first leadership model that required every leader, including myself, to develop genuine operational literacy with AI.</p>



<p>We created a three-prong program for this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="prong-1-ai-literacy-for-leadership">Prong 1: AI literacy for leadership</h3>



<p>The first prong was building a foundational understanding, where every leader had to understand AI. Not just the platforms or tools, but the very understanding of architecture, governance and competitive advantage it holds.</p>



<p>This included understanding both the theoretical and behavioral differences between different large language models (LLMs). Learning about the data dependencies, understanding how the quality and scope of training data impacts output reliability, etc.</p>



<p>I also worked with other leads and managers to understand viscerally why we need confidence scoring thresholds and where we need human verification checkpoints. This direct engagement showed us opportunities that traditional analysis would have missed — areas where competitors were likely implementing AI superficially, creating openings for more sophisticated, operationally-grounded approaches.</p>



<p>We empathized with our teams’ experiences, understanding the frustration of prompts that yielded inconsistent results, the challenge of discerning technically correct but contextually wrong AI output and the significant time investment required for proper validation and refinement of AI-generated work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="prong-2-ai-leadership-pods">Prong 2: AI leadership pods</h3>



<p>The second prong was bringing it all together. We formed four groups of cross-functional AI leadership pods: Visioneers, Architects, Pathfinders and Creators.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="visioneers">Visioneers</h3>



<p>As strategic problem identifiers, Visioneers play a crucial role in bridging organizational needs with AI possibilities. Their understanding of market pressures, customer pain points and competitive threats allows them to spot where AI can create genuine business advantage, not just technical novelty.</p>



<p>I led the Visioneers pod alongside our CMO and head of product. Our key responsibility was asking: “What business problems are worth solving with AI?” rather than “What can AI do for us?” We own the business case, meaning we must justify why solving specific problems with AI will generate measurable ROI, not just operational efficiency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="architects">Architects</h3>



<p>Also known as workflow designers, Architects are the operational leaders who translate strategic vision into practical reality. They take the problems identified by Visioneers and design the actual human-AI workflows that will solve them effectively.</p>



<p>Their critical insight is understanding where human judgment remains essential and where AI can reliably handle tasks. They’re responsible for creating the guardrails — the quality checkpoints, oversight mechanisms and failure protocols that ensure AI integration improves rather than compromises work quality.</p>



<p>Our head of engineering took the lead on the Architects pod, but the entire leadership team participated in workflow redesign sessions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pathfinders">Pathfinders</h3>



<p>Operating as the organization’s AI intelligence network, a group of R&amp;D, data analytics and product leaders continuously explores emerging AI capabilities, runs controlled experiments and stress-tests new possibilities before they become mainstream.</p>



<p>Their value isn’t just staying current with AI developments — it’s providing vetted, practical assessments of what’s ready for business application versus what’s still experimental. They feed proven concepts to Architects and identify emerging opportunities for Visioneers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="creators">Creators</h3>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, this pod ensured that strategic leaders maintained a direct connection with technical implementation realities. Creators are the hands-on technical experts who build, integrate and maintain AI systems. They execute the workflows designed by Architects, but with crucial input into what’s technically feasible and sustainable.</p>



<p>Their role isn’t just coding. They ensure that AI implementations are secure, scalable and maintainable over time, not just functional in initial deployments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="these-pods-operate-in-structured-cycles">These pods operate in structured cycles</h3>



<p>Visioneers identify high-impact problems monthly, Architects design solutions and collaborate with Creators on implementation, while Pathfinders provide ongoing intelligence about emerging possibilities. This network creates continuous feedback between strategic direction, practical design, technical implementation and innovation — preventing the silos that typically sabotage technology initiatives.</p>



<p>This collaborative leadership approach has proven beneficial across many industries undertaking AI initiatives. A recent article published in Harvard Business Review points out that, “In companies where AI is taking root, the best leadership is distributed, with many executives working in sync.” We took a similar approach by turning distributed responsibility into distributed operational fluency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="prong-3-measure-and-iterate-to-improve">Prong 3: Measure and iterate to improve</h3>



<p>The third prong was incentivizing realignment and progress parameterization.In simpler terms, this was aboutmeasuring how effective our approach was and improving it with continuous iterations. Because what gets measured gets improved.</p>



<p>Traditional productivity metrics would have had us celebrating faster report generation or increased content output. But working directly with AI tools taught us that raw output gains often mask hidden costs and quality degradation.</p>



<p>Hence, we worked with the following parameters:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="amplification-ratio">Amplification ratio</h3>



<p><em>(Time saved on automated tasks) / (Time invested in AI oversight + training)</em></p>



<p>When I personally spent hours refining prompts to generate a suitable marketing copy, I understood that the “time saved” calculation had to include the time invested in making AI outputs actually valuable.</p>



<p>For our engineering team, we discovered that AI code generation with a 10:1 amplification ratio (100 hours saved, 10 hours invested in review and refinement) was far more valuable than generation with a 3:1 ratio, even if the latter produced more total code.</p>



<p>This insight only emerged because leadership team members had personally experienced the difference between AI code that worked and AI code that was maintainable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-influenced-quality-delta-aqd">AI-influenced quality delta (AQD)</h3>



<p><em>(Post-AI quality score) – (Pre-AI quality score)</em></p>



<p>This metric tracks whether AI is actually improving work quality, not just work speed. The AQD measures the difference in quality scores before and after AI implementation. For example, in engineering, this might mean 20% fewer production bugs after implementing AI code review. For marketing teams, it could represent 15% higher customer engagement on AI-assisted campaigns. This metric ensures that AI adoption improves outcomes, not just outputs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="innovation-yield">Innovation yield</h3>



<p><em>(Number of AI-powered ideas tested per quarter) × (Success rate of implemented ideas)</em></p>



<p>Our Pathfinders pod tested dozens of AI applications quarterly, but success wasn’t just about technical functionality — it was about meaningful business impact. In practice, this means if we test 10 AI applications quarterly and 2 get scaled organization-wide with measurable business impact, you’re tracking both experimental velocity and conversion effectiveness. It prevents endless pilot programs that never translate into operational improvements.</p>



<p>Only leaders who had personally worked through AI prediction tools could distinguish between technical success and business value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-fluency-score">AI fluency score</h3>



<p>This metric provides a qualitative 360-degree assessment of whether leaders can actually guide AI adoption effectively or just manage it abstractly. It measures peer and team feedback on whether leaders can troubleshoot AI tools, provide concrete guidance and make informed decisions about AI applications based on hands-on understanding rather than vendor promises. Teams immediately recognize the difference between leaders who speak from AI experience and this directly impacts adoption effectiveness throughout the organization. A high AI fluency score indicates that leaders have the practical skills and experience to effectively lead AI initiatives, while a low score may indicate a need for further training and hands-on experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="finding-the-ai-sizzle">Finding the AI sizzle</h3>



<p>Within six months, our hand-first approach delivered concrete gains. Production bugs dropped 35% and marketing engagement increased 28%. Most significantly, our Innovation Yield jumped from 15% to 65%. We shifted our focus from scaling AI tools that merely worked and focused on applications with genuine business impact. An internal NPS survey revealed that team confidence in leadership guidance increased 73%, accelerating adoption across all departments. We’re now expanding this model to emerging technologies like agentic AI, applying the same operational fluency principle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting started: Pick one workflow</h3>



<p>The greatest irony of the AI era is that the technology designed to eliminate human limitations actually requires more human understanding than any innovation before it. The leaders who succeed won’t be those who delegate AI adoption; they’ll be those willing to become students again.</p>



<p>The path forward requires abandoning the comfortable distance that executive leadership traditionally maintains during technology transitions. Pick one AI workflow that matters to your organization’s core operations. Spend two weeks developing genuine operational fluency with the tools involved. Experience the frustrations, understand the quality control challenges and learn to distinguish between impressive demos and reliable business applications.</p>



<p>Every breakthrough technology will increasingly demand this same hands-on leadership approach. The pace of innovation means leaders can no longer afford the luxury of learning about transformative technologies — they must learn to work with them directly.</p>



<p>Five years from now, there will be only one type of leader: those who can troubleshoot alongside their teams. They will be running AI-native organizations that competitors can’t replicate.</p>
