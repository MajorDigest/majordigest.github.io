     <p>If you haven't shopped Amazon's October Prime Day sale yet, I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that you have just hours left to shop for bargains, as the sale ends tonight at 11:59 p.m. PDT. The good news is that thousands of Prime Day deals are still available, and this year's bargains are <em>very</em> good.<br><br>• Shop Amazon's full Prime Day sale<br><br>As TechRadar's deals editor who's covered Prime Day for eight years, I'm breaking down everything you need to know about today's Prime Day sale, including what deals you absolutely need to see before the event ends.<br><br>I've listed the most popular Prime Day deals below, based on what our readers are loving and today's best discounts.

If you haven't already snagged a bargain, I've listed the best deals still available further down the page.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When do Prime Day deals end?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>If you're wondering if all Prime Day deals end when the sale does (tonight at 11:59 PM PDT), the answer is a bit complicated. Most deals will likely end when Prime Day does. I've covered the sale for eight years now, and the best Prime Day deals will expire when the sale ends.<br><br>The next time you'll see discounts like this will be at one of Amazon's early Black Friday sale events or on Black Friday itself (November 28).</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Do you need a Prime membership to shop Amazon's October sale?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Just like Amazon's July Prime Day sale, you need a Prime membership to shop today's Prime Day sale. Luckily, if you aren't already a member, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial right now, which gets you access to Amazon's event.<br><br>Amazon Prime perks include free shipping, access to Prime Video, Prime Music, and much more.</p></article></section>
