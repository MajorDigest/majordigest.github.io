<p>Businesses are constantly evolving their use of technology, resulting in almost constant organizational change. Currently, AI is sweeping through business and tech across every industry, and getting an entire organization on board with any emerging tech, especially one as contentious as AI, requires strong leadership and change management skills to implement change and make it stick.</p>



<p>Whenever an organization implements a new process, updates an existing one, deploys new technology, or fine-tunes services, its leaders must be mindful that even a simple change to a single process can start a domino effect, introducing issues in a range of other processes that must also be addressed. That’s why it’s vital to have a strong change management plan in place so the company can remain agile and flexible, without interruptions or downtime. </p>



<p>But every change management plan, large or small, requires skilled professionals who understand the intricacies of change management.</p>



<p>Change management is relevant to nearly every industry, but it’s particularly important for businesses looking to improve processes, increase efficiency, and reduce errors and risk in IT, project management, and software and product development.</p>



<p>Looking to become an agent of change at your company? Here are 10 change management certifications you can earn to prove your skills.</p>

The content of each exam is based on the institute’s Change Manager Competency Model. At the foundation level, you’ll need to send in a written application that provides your capabilities and competencies, along with a reference from a manager who has directly observed your behavior in a change management role. You’ll also need to complete relevant change management education, either through a CMI-endorsed course or one that aligns with the Change Management Body of Knowledge (CMBoK). For the Specialist level, you’ll need three to six years of experience operating at the project or program level, and submit a written assessment with references that provides evidence of your skills. You’ll also need to complete a virtual interview with an independent assessor. The Master level is for highly experienced, senior change practitioners to stand out from their peers as leaders in the profession, and is best suited for those with more than seven years’ experience.</p>



<p>Exam fee: Foundation: $525, discounted to $450 with CMI-endorsed training; Specialist: $675; Master: $1,050</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="change-management-specialist-cms">Change Management Specialist (CMS)</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="project-management-professional-pmp">Project Management Professional (PMP)</h3>



<p>The Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project Management Institute (PMI) is another great option for those looking to validate change management skills and expertise. Project and change management often go together as PMI states that a project is a task with a defined end target, and that the role of project management is to manage the change process that’ll help achieve the end goal, while keeping time and budget in mind. Change management and change process often require full-time management, and that can often fall to project managers. The PMP certification is a perfect fit for anyone who finds themselves straddling project and change manager.</p>

It takes place over the course of three days, where you’ll learn how to apply Prosci’s methodology and the ADKAR model to real-world projects. The exam fee is steep, but includes hotel accommodations, all meals, and any activities included in the program. The company also handles hotel reservations, as it’s a requirement to stay at the venue for the three-day workshop. Workshops take place in a variety of locations across the US, typically at picturesque resorts and vacation spots. You can also opt for a virtual experience instead.</p>
