From what we've seen so far, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a very unique kind of racing game, able to distinguish itself from Nintendo Switch 2 launch title <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/mario-kart-world-review" target="_blank"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> in a number of ways.

These sessions go live November 8, and conclude on November 16.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-kirby-air-riders-direct-start-time"><span>Kirby Air Riders Direct start time</span></h3><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct #2 started on October 23, 2025 at the times below:</p><ul><li><strong>East Coast (United States):</strong> 9AM ET</li><li><strong>West Coast (United States):</strong> 6AM PT</li><li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> 2PM BST</li><li><strong>Central Europe:</strong> 3PM CEST</li><li><strong>Australia (Sydney):</strong> 11PM AEST</li><li><strong>Japan (Tokyo):</strong> 10PM JST</li></ul><p>This Direct event lasted one hour.

You can watch this first Direct below:</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-where-to-watch-the-kirby-air-riders-direct-on-october-23"><span>Where to watch the Kirby Air Riders Direct on October 23</span></h3><p>You can watch The <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct #2 over on the official Nintendo YouTube channels. We've embedded a link below:</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div><p>Make sure to arrive at the times detailed previously in this article, as there will likely be a short countdown before the show starts. From there, expect a full presentation from director Masahiro Sakurai, lasting 60 minutes in total.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-live-coverage-as-it-happens"><span>Live coverage as it happens</span></h3><h3 id="welcome-to-our-live-build-up-to-today-s-kirby-air-riders-direct-2">Welcome to our live build up to today's Kirby Air Riders Direct </h3><p>Welcome in Kirby fans! There's a <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct airing later today, and it'll apparently last for a full hour. I'll be hear covering the build up live, giving you all the info revealed so far, before switching over to live impressions once the Direct begins.</p><h3 id="here-s-when-today-s-kirby-air-riders-direct-starts-2">Here's when today's Kirby Air Riders Direct starts</h3><p>The second <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct begins later today at the times below:</p><ul><li><strong>East Coast (United States):</strong> 9AM ET</li><li><strong>West Coast (United States):</strong> 6AM PT</li><li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> 2PM BST</li><li><strong>Central Europe:</strong> 3PM CEST</li><li><strong>Australia (Sydney):</strong> 11PM AEST</li><li><strong>Japan (Tokyo):</strong> 10PM JST</li></ul><h3 id="when-does-kirby-air-riders-come-out-2">When does Kirby Air Riders come out?</h3><p>We already know that <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> launches November 20, 2025 exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2. It's likely the very last major Switch 2 exclusive we'll see this year, as <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> also launches on Nintendo Switch.</p><h3 id="where-to-watch-the-kirby-air-riders-direct-2">Where to watch the Kirby Air Riders Direct</h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div><p>You can watch the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct by heading to the Nintendo official YouTube channels. We've even embedded the streaming link above.</p><h3 id="just-two-hours-to-go-2">Just two hours to go!</h3><p>The <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct will go live in just two hours. I'm expecting some news on story content, and possibly a tease as to whether there will be post-launch support.</p><h3 id="only-an-hour-and-a-quarter-to-go-2">Only an hour and a quarter to go!</h3><p>Less than an hour and half now until we'll get our next deep dive into Kirby Air Riders. Start planning your time and movement across the next couple of hours, and make sure to tune in for our live coverage when it all kicks off.</p><h3 id="just-one-hour-to-go-2">Just one hour to go!</h3><p>Boy, that's crept up on us - there's only one hour to go before the Kirby Air Riders Direct starts.</p><p>Strap in, and let's hope for a host of cool details and bits of info!</p><h3 id="my-hopes-for-the-kirby-air-riders-direct-2">My hopes for the Kirby Air Riders Direct</h3><p>Now that we're just minutes away from the next <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct, I'm thinking about what I'd actually like to see during the show. As someone that never played the first game, I'm finding the deep dives into gameplay mechanics a little bit overwhelming, so some basic overviews of standard races would be nice. I'd also love to see whether there's any story content tying the game together, even if it's just small lore drops for each racer, alongside some nice cutscenes.</p><p>Mostly, I need to decide whether there's a broader appeal to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, as currently it does look to be a bit of a niche offering. Having enjoyed <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but not as much as I'd expected, I'm definitely up for trying out a new racer on Switch 2, however.</p><h3 id="30-minutes-to-go-2">30 minutes to go</h3><p>We're now just half an hour away from the start of the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct. It's set to run for an hour, so expect a hefty amount of detail from the esteemed Mr. Sakurai. Honesty, even if you're not interested in the game, watching Mr. Sakurai present is an absolute joy.</p><h3 id="kirby-air-riders-amiibo-launch-alongside-the-game-2">Kirby Air Riders amiibo launch alongside the game</h3><p>Two new amiibo will launch alongside <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. These include a Bandana Waddle Dee & Winged Star amiibo, and the Kirby & Warp Star amiibo. Both have the potential to trigger in-game bonuses when held against the Switch 2's NFC tag.</p><h3 id="the-show-has-started-follow-our-reactions-live-as-the-reveals-happen-2">The show has started! Follow our reactions live, as the reveals happen</h3><p>The <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct is now live. Let's dig into what's being shown. Looks like we're kicking off with an overview on key details like release date and platforms.</p><h3 id="top-ride-mode-announced-2">Top Ride mode announced</h3><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> harkens back to its predecessor with a Top Ride Mode, which plays out with a top-down camera view.</p><h3 id="courses-for-top-ride-include-flower-and-flow-2">Courses for Top Ride include Flower and Flow</h3><p>We're now getting a look at some courses that feature in Top Ride. There's Flower, Air, Flow, Steam, and more. The courses are wider this time around.</p><h3 id="top-ride-is-designed-as-a-more-casual-pick-up-and-play-experience-2">Top Ride is designed as a more casual, pick up and play experience</h3><p>Mr. Sakurai describes Top Ride as a more casual experience, with shorter, more pick up and play races.</p><h3 id="road-trip-mode-adds-challenges-to-complete-2">Road Trip mode adds challenges to complete</h3><p>A new mode called Road Trip is being shown off. It offers small challenges as you drive around a track. It looks as though this is geared more towards solo play.</p><h3 id="you-ll-make-your-own-drivers-license-2">You'll make your own drivers license</h3><p>When playing online in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, you'll make a profile in the form of a drivers license. Backgrounds, titles and other visuals can be tweaked.</p><h3 id="there-s-a-lobby-that-you-can-explore-before-races-2">There's a lobby that you can explore before races</h3><p>There's a lobby area filled with things to do before a game. You can walk and jump around, spectate, change music, and emote with other players.</p><h3 id="ranking-is-determined-by-the-class-system-2">Ranking is determined by the Class system</h3><p>Online ranking comes in the form of Class. This is similar to how things worked in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, in that you're ranked above and below certain players, identified by a color. This hopes to match you with other players of the same skill level.</p><h3 id="races-includes-tracks-from-the-previous-game-2">Races includes tracks from the previous game</h3><p>Tracks from <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> are available in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. This includes Sky Sands, Frozen Hillside, and Magma Flows.</p><h3 id="18-courses-in-total-2">18 courses in total!</h3><p>There are 18 courses in total, including 9 old and 9 new ones. Music returns from the last game too.</p><h3 id="city-trial-details-announced-2">City Trial details announced</h3><p>Now there's a breakdown of City Trial, which is the fan-favorite mode. There's new items, including Fireworks, Item Catcher and Laser Swiper.</p><h3 id="team-battles-split-players-into-two-teams-for-city-trial-2">Team Battles split players into two teams for City Trial</h3><p>More info on City Trial now, as Team Battle will split players into two teams. You'll share certain items between teammates. Looks like great fun for up to 16 players!</p><h3 id="new-riders-include-taranza-and-daroach-2">New Riders include Taranza and Daroach</h3><p>There's new Riders in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> including Lololo & Lalala, Daroach and Taranza. There's a heavy hamster called Rick, and Marx is here too.</p><h3 id="machines-are-being-showcased-2">Machines are being showcased</h3><p>Formula Star, Hop Star and Transform Star are available to use in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. There's a Wheelie Scooter too with a giant eye in the wheel, and a Bull Tank that looks straight out of Robot Wars.</p><h3 id="you-can-change-the-voice-announcer-2">You can change the voice announcer</h3><p>The in-game voice announcer can be changed to different options, including several different languages. There's German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and more options.</p><h3 id="flight-star-is-exclusive-to-free-run-2">Flight Star is exclusive to Free Run</h3><p>There's an exclusive machine called Flight Star that's included in Free Run. You can use this to fly around tracks, perfect for solo play and learning the game mechanics.</p><h3 id="vs-boss-mode-lets-you-battle-tough-foes-2">Vs. Boss mode lets you battle tough foes</h3><p>Robo Dedede is just one of the bosses that's featured in Vs. Boss mode. You'll race around and battle a large enemy, using items and locking on for attacks.</p><h3 id="i-cannot-believe-how-much-is-in-this-game-2">I cannot believe how much is in this game!</h3><p>Checklists, color variants, a robotic Dedede boss fight? I truly cannot keep up. We're now seeing My Machine, that let's you customize your own vehicle.</p><h3 id="you-can-share-custom-machine-designs-2">You can share custom Machine designs</h3><p>Once you've customized via My Machine, you can share them with others. I think I saw an auction system, so perhaps there's incentive to create good designs. We'll have to confirm this later on.</p><h3 id="headwear-can-be-purchased-with-miles-2">Headwear can be purchased with Miles</h3><p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> features a currency called Miles. These are earned as you play, and can be spent in the Miles Shop in exchange for Headwear, Stickers and other items.</p><h3 id="my-music-can-be-used-to-choose-your-own-soundtrack-2">My Music can be used to choose your own soundtrack</h3><p>There's a My Music feature where you can adjust how often certain Music appears while playing. There's a Music Player too, where you can listen to the game's soundtrack whenever you like.</p><h3 id="we-re-now-going-through-the-options-menu-2">We're now going through the Options menu</h3><p>Almost an hour in, the <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>Direct is now guiding us through the options menu. There's some Accessibility features too, which is very good to see. Color filters and UI element options are available.</p><h3 id="amiibo-can-be-trained-in-game-2">amiibo can be trained in-game</h3><p>Just like in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, amiibo can be scanned into <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> to be trained as Riders. There's brand new Meta Knight, Chef Kawasaki, and Dedede amiibo too.</p><h3 id="story-mode-unveiled-2">Story Mode unveiled</h3><p>Road Trip is the main Story mode in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. We're now seeing a cutscene that'll play at the beginning of the adventure. It's showing off some very nice visuals, highlighting Machines and Riders.</p><h3 id="that-s-a-wrap-2">That's a wrap!</h3><p>Wow, that was a lot to take in. For me, the headline announcements were the Road Trip story mode, the inclusion of old tracks, and the total course list being 18 at launch. An online demo event is on the way too. You can check out the dates above.</p><h3 id="final-teaser-shows-off-the-fountain-of-dreams-2">Final teaser shows off the Fountain of Dreams</h3><p>There were a couple of teasers shown at the end of the Kirby Air Riders Direct. One showed Fountain of Dreams, a Kirby area that's synonymous with the Smash Bros. series. What this all means, we'll have to wait and see.</p><h3 id="release-dates-for-the-three-new-amiibo-2">Release dates for the three new amiibo</h3><p>Nintendo has revealed the release dates for the new amiibo figures. The Meta Knight & Shadow Star amiibo arrives March 5, 2026. Then, we can expect the King Dedede & Tank Star amiibo, and the Chef Kawasaki & Hop Star amiibo some time in 2026.</p><h3 id="mix-up-air-ride-with-swap-relay-2">Mix up Air Ride with Swap Relay</h3><p>Swap Relay races are a part of Air Ride, and allow players to choose multiple Machines that match the number of laps being played. At the end of each lap, you'll automatically swap to a new vehicle. Try out different combinations to see which ones work together in sequence.</p><h3 id="beat-opponents-online-to-earn-gummies-2">Beat opponents online to earn Gummies</h3><p>Gummies are one of the stranger aspects of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. You'll earn Gummies shaped like the Machines of the opponents you beat in online matches. These are collectibles that can be earned and then viewed in a dedicated menu. You can use a cursor to interact with your ever-growing pile of Gummies, but it's unclear what other function they serve. Perhaps they are just fun Trophies.</p><h3 id="now-we-wait-for-release-day-2">Now we wait for release day</h3><p>I'm heading off now, concluding TechRadar's live coverage of the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct. You can still check out all of the announcements on this page, including what to expect from the story mode, and when you'll be able to try the demo. All that's left to do is wait until November 20, when the game will be out worldwide.</p>
