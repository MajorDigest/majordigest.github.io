Below are the main changes:</p><ul><li>Improved core movement and animations, including smoother landings, faster stance transitions, better vaulting behavior, and reduced “bouncing” issues on landing or spawning.</li><li>Reworked weapon dispersion to better align accuracy and handling with each weapon’s intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where accuracy behaved inconsistently, such as dispersion not properly settling after sprinting, and bring overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power.</li><li>Significant visibility and lighting improvements, with better exposure transitions, interior lighting, and reduced fog and smoke persistence.</li></ul><h3 id="no-downtime-planned-for-battlefield-redsec-2">No downtime planned for Battlefield REDSEC</h3><p>There's no downtime planned for <em>Battlefield </em>6 Season One and <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>.

Strikepoint is a 4v4 multiplayer affair that pits two squads against each other in close-quarters combat. They'll battle it out over a single objective, with only one life per player, per round. This one is for Hardcore players.</p><h3 id="battlefield-redsec-release-time-countdown-just-3-hours-to-go-2">Battlefield REDSEC release time countdown: Just 3 hours to go!</h3><p>There's just 3 hours to go until <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>, and <em>Battlefield 6</em> Season One go live. You can still play the game in the meantime, but be sure to keep an eye out for news on potential updates you'll need to download.</p><h3 id="new-attachments-arriving-soon-2">New attachments arriving soon</h3><p>Season One will add Rail Covers for some rifles and LMGs that increase the draw speed of each weapon. Low Powered Variable Optics scopes also add new options for the magnification on LMGs and rifles. These new attachments drop as part of October 28's major update.</p><h3 id="is-there-a-preload-for-season-one-and-battlefield-redsec-2">Is there a preload for Season One and Battlefield REDSEC?</h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div><p>By the looks of things, there's no preload available for <em>Battlefield 6</em> Season One, or <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>. The former has already been updated, and there's no downtime planned, so you should be good to go once the content goes live. In terms of REDSEC, we don't yet know whether it'll be a separate download, or within the BF6 launcher.</p><h3 id="battlefield-redsec-release-time-countdown-two-hours-until-it-s-here-2">Battlefield REDSEC release time countdown:  Two hours until it's here!</h3><p>There's no better way to convey a sense of waiting around than a creepy skeleton wearing a cheap tie - at least according to stock image websites.</p><p>If you're starting to feel a bit like our bony friend up there, then take comfort in the fact that we won't waiting for much longer.</p><p>The <em>Battlefield 6 </em>Season One launch, and by extension <em>REDSEC </em>release, are just two hours away.</p><p>It'll be here before you know it.</p><h3 id="is-battlefield-6-about-to-get-a-new-launcher-2">Is Battlefield 6 about to get a new launcher?</h3><p>One of my biggest questions in the build up to the <em>Battlefield: REDSEC </em>launch is just how the free-to-play version is going to work.</p><p>Unlike <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Battlefield 6 </em>isn't really its own game launcher so I'm wondering whether the free version will be a totally separate application on digital storefronts.</p><p>There's also a chance that EA will update how <em>Battlefield 6 </em>functions, adding an extra screen that allows you to choose between the campaign and multiplayer (if you already own it) and <em>REDSEC</em>.</p><p>I'm interested to see whether <em>Battlefield 6 </em>owners will be able to choose to uninstall the multiplayer modes in order to save some console storage too, as is currently the case with <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>.</p><h3 id="battlefield-redsec-is-available-to-download-and-you-likely-already-have-it-installed-2">Battlefield REDSEC is available to download, and you likely already have it installed</h3><p>It seems that <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> was added to <em>Battlefield 6</em> as part of this morning's update. If you head into the in-game settings, scroll to "System" and then select the install option, you can check what you have installed. You should see an option for REDSEC, as well as a texture pack. Make sure these are checked, so that you're ready to go for later.</p><h3 id="battlefield-redsec-release-time-countdown-one-hour-to-go-2">Battlefield REDSEC release time countdown: One hour to go!</h3><p>We're now just one hour away from the release of <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>. As per my last post, you should already have it installed, but be sure to check. Season One adds the Blackwell Fields map in an hour too, and I can't wait to try it out.</p><h3 id="there-s-two-more-big-content-drops-planned-for-season-one-2">There's two more big content drops planned for Season One</h3><p>While today's Season One launch will add plenty to <em>Battlefield </em>6, there's actually two more updates planned for 2025. On November 18, there will be a new map, mode, and weapons. Then, on December 9, the Ice Lock event will start, blanketing the Empire State map in a blanket of snow.</p><h3 id="just-30-minutes-until-battlefield-redsec-goes-live-2">Just 30 minutes until Battlefield REDSEC goes live!</h3><p>Well, we now only have half an hour to wait until <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> launches. Once it does, I'll be providing my early impressions of the new battle royale mode. Follow along live to see what I think!</p><h3 id="what-i-d-love-to-see-from-the-battlefield-battle-royale-mode-2">What I'd love to see from the Battlefield battle royale mode</h3><p>With the release of the new <em>Battlefield 6</em> Battle Royale mode imminent, I'm hoping that EA hasn't made things too complicated at launch. I'd like a simple closing storm mechanic, a simple loot system, and a detailed map that stands on its own two feet. Of course, I'd expect the battle royale map to re-use some elements from the main game, but I'm hoping there's some new POIs as well.</p><p>Movement will be an interesting wrinkle, and I'm hoping that the actual feel of REDSEC matches the multiplayer modes. Shared progression, and a unified movement system are key for me to want to swap between the main two modes, and I'd love it if there was some kind of revive mechanic like how the Gulag works in <em>Warzone</em>.</p><h3 id="battlefield-6-season-one-and-redsec-are-now-live-2">Battlefield 6 Season One and REDSEC are now live!</h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"></div></div><p>The major update has landed, meaning you can now jump into <em>Battlefield 6</em> Season One, as well as <em>Battlefield: REDSEC. </em>Stay tuned for my live impressions as I jump into the new battle royale mode.</p><h3 id="and-i-m-queuing-2">And I'm queuing</h3><p>There's already decent queues for <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>. I was placed at position 4, 800, though that only took 30 seconds or so.</p><h3 id="battlefield-redsec-modes-include-gauntlet-duos-and-quads-2">Battlefield REDSEC modes include Gauntlet, Duos, and Quads</h3><p>Looks like there's 3 major modes for Battlefield REDSEC currently. Gauntlet is an objective based mode, while battle royale is</p><h3 id="you-get-one-redeploy-per-battle-royale-match-2">You get one redeploy per battle royale match</h3><p>You drop into <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> with a pistol, and must then loot weapons and complete missions to make it out alive. If you're downed, you get once chance to come back.</p><h3 id="jump-into-battle-royale-initiation-to-learn-the-ropes-2">Jump into Battle Royale Initiation to learn the ropes</h3><p>The Training Grounds area has been updated with Initiation Battle Royale. This is perfect for learning how REDSEC works, and has the following changes:</p><ul><li>This version of Fort Lyndon is significantly smaller than its full version. </li><li>Players who can access this mode are limited to newer players.</li><li>A 48-player maximum, inclusive of Bots.</li></ul><h3 id="here-s-the-battlefield-redsec-map-2">Here's the Battlefield REDSEC map</h3><p>Fort Lyndon is the main map for <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>. You can check it out in the image above. 46 players can drop in at one time, and there's squads of two or four currently.</p><h3 id="which-battlefield-redsec-class-should-you-pick-2">Which Battlefield REDSEC class should you pick?</h3><p>There are four classes to choose from in Battlefield: REDSEC, and they operate largely in the same way as they do in the base game. Here's info on each, so that you can decide which one's for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Assault – </strong>The ultimate frontline fighter, skilled at punching through enemy defenses. Dominate close to mid-range encounters and limit the enemy’s ability to fight.</li><li><strong>Engineer –</strong> The battlefield’s leading vehicle and equipment technician. Execute repairs to keep allies combat effective, or strike hostile armor with force to break their attack.</li><li><strong>Support –</strong> The backbone of any combat unit for defense and sustained fighting. Heal and resupply friendly forces, while fortifying defensive positions to keep them protected.</li><li><strong>Recon –</strong> The perfect intelligence and counterintelligence operative. Neutralize targets from a distance, or infiltrate, gathering intel and disrupting hostile forces.</li></ul><h3 id="okay-this-battle-pass-is-a-bit-underwhelming-2">Okay, this Battle pass is a bit underwhelming</h3><p>With the launch of Season One we also get our very first battle pass and, honestly, it hasn't made the best impression.</p><p>I know the developers are keen to avoid silly cosmetics here, but I think what's on offer is pretty boring.</p><p>Is anyone desperate to grind through level after level to get their hands on a skin that basically just boils down to a slightly different camo color?</p><p>Even the outfit you get for completing the entire pass is pretty mediocre.</p><h3 id="ps5-players-can-claim-a-free-player-card-background-2">PS5 players can claim a free Player Card Background</h3><p>If you head to the <em>Battlefield 6</em> or REDSEC in-game store, you'll find a free Player Card Background for PS5 players. The Plausible Deniability item is available for the next six days.</p><h3 id="my-first-impressions-of-battlefield-redsec-2">My first impressions of Battlefield: REDSEC</h3><p>So far, I'm enjoying <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>. It's extremely streamlined, in a way that reminds me of how battle royale games used to feel a few years back. The movement is slow, and you can't just vault your way up buildings. Shooting feels great, and the loot system is simple enough without needing extra inventories or menus. The map is noticeably less visually exciting than the multiplayer maps, but given the scale, it's acceptable. I'm excited to play more!</p><h3 id="gauntlet-is-very-fun-2">Gauntlet is very fun</h3><p>Gauntlet puts you and your squad in a small area of the map to compete with others in different kinds of modes. You must be one of the top teams to progress, with four rounds in total. It's a blast so far.</p><h3 id="you-ll-drop-in-as-a-squad-directed-by-your-squad-leader-2">You'll drop in as a squad, directed by your squad leader</h3><p>In a similar way to how dropping-in works in <em>Apex Legends</em>, you'll drop in as a squad in formation in <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em>. Your squad leader will steer the whole team, but you can also break away and drop on your own if you so wish.</p><h3 id="that-s-all-for-today-2">That's all for today!</h3><p>I'm heading off now. I'll be jumping into <em>Battlefield REDSEC</em> this evening with some pals, trying out the Gauntlet mode and grinding for a new sniper rifle. I'll have updated impressions tomorrow morning.</p>
