The Six Nations sides play host, with the touring Rugby Championship teams, plus Fiji, Tonga, Japan and the USA also featuring.</p><p><strong>England</strong> improved the longer the Six Nations went on and Steve Borthwick is now trying to evolve what has been a stodgy style into something more free-flowing with George Ford at fly-half, Tommy Freeman at center and even flanker Henry Pollock tested on the wing. <strong>Ireland </strong>get head coach Andy Farrell back after Lions duty, with the 18 tourists – including fit-again Caelan Doris – also all returning to a squad packed with experience. Fly-half Sam Prendegast needs to stamp his authority on games against big beasts New Zealand and South Africa.</p><p><strong>Scotland </strong>have supreme backs Blair Kinghorn, Finn Russell and Darcy Graham but need more forward power to go into next year's Six Nations with more confidence. <strong>Wales</strong> have Louis Rees-Zammit back from his stint in the NFL and managed to stop an 18-game losing streak against Japan last time out as the Steve Tandy era takes shape. <strong>France</strong> may get captain Antoine Dupont back from injury late in November, but fly-half Matthieu Jalibert and lock Romain Taofifenua are the latest casualties. Les Bleus' opening fixture against South Africa should be a classic.</p><p><strong>South Africa </strong>just about managed to defend their Rugby Championship crown but the Springboks were inconsistent and even let a 22-0 lead slip against Australia. The play five times and will hope newly uncovered fly-half Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu can continue his stellar recent form. <strong>Australia</strong> will look to continue their momentum after a better-than-expected showing against the Lions and impressive Rugby Championship campaign that included that first win at Ellis Park against the Boks for 62 years. All eyes will again be on the influential Rob Valenti's fitness issues. <strong>New Zealand </strong>will have the three Barrett brothers in Europe, along with improving scrum half Cam Roigard, but doubts are rising over head coach Scott Robertson after an inconsistent Rugby Championship in which they won back, then lost again, the world number one ranking.</p><p>Elsewhere, the talented <strong>Fiji</strong> get a chance to show their minerals against England and France after impressing at the last Rugby World Cup, <strong>Tonga </strong>visit Murrayfield with hulking prop Ben Tameifuna looking to add to his glowing reputation and <strong>USA </strong>also play Scotland ahead of their hosting of the 2031 World Cup. Meanwhile, <strong>Japan</strong> will look to bloody more big-boy noses, which is exactly what head coach Eddie Jones loves doing most.</p><p>Here's where to watch the Autumn Internationals 2025 live streams online from anywhere, <strong>potentially for FREE.</strong></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-autumn-internationals-2025-next-games-round-1"><span>Autumn Internationals 2025 next games – Round 1</span></h3><p><strong>Saturday, November 1</strong></p><p><strong>England vs Australia</strong> | <em>3.10pm GMT / 11.10am ET / 8.10am PT / 2.10am AEDT (Sun.)</em><br>Twickenham, London, UK</p><p><strong>Scotland vs USA</strong> | <em>5.40pm GMT / 1.40pm ET / 10.40am PT / 4.40am AEDT (Sun.)</em><br>Murrayfield, Edinburgh, UK</p><p><strong>Ireland vs New Zealand</strong> | <em>8.10pm GMT / 3.10pm / 12.10am PT / 7.10am AEDT (Sun.)</em><br>Soldier Field, Chicago, USA</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-watch-the-autumn-internationals-2025-for-free"><span>Watch the Autumn Internationals 2025 for FREE</span></h3><p>Rugby union fans, rejoice!
