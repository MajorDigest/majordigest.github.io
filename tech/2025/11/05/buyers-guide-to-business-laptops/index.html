<p>With hundreds of business-oriented laptops to choose from, picking the right ones to outfit your company’s workforce can be daunting. We’re here to help with a buyer’s guide that breaks the options into categories and provides details, price estimates, and pros and cons of each.</p>



<p>Ranging from $200 for the cheapest budget models to nearly $10,000 for monster systems with all the bells and whistles, business laptops typically cost more than similar systems aimed at consumers. (All prices in this guide are in US dollars.) What you get for that extra cash often includes the business-ready Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise operating system, the best components, customization options, and a variety of support and warranty choices.</p>



<p>This is where your inner haggler should emerge. The more systems your organization buys, the more leverage you have to push the price down and/or extract extras, like extended warranties. Don’t miss the opportunity to bargain, at least a little.</p>



<p>(For help deciding whether to source business PCs through a reseller, managed service provider, or directly from the vendor, see “How to buy PCs for your enterprise.”)</p>



<p>Laptops’ predictable lifespan — four to five years, according to extended warranty vendor Asurion — makes leasing the systems an attractive alternative by turning a large capital cost into a manageable monthly expense. Leasing means you’ll always have the latest technology (or nearly so), and when the lease is up, you don’t have to worry about hardware disposal.</p>



<p>To help you choose the right laptops for your users, this guide focuses on workloads, who will use the systems, and the hardware and software they’ll need to do it. We’ve divided the market into five categories that range from mainstream, budget, and ultraslim devices to professional tablets, hybrids, and mobile workstations. Each archetype represents a different design philosophy that leads to a diverse mix of hardware for varied tasks and workstyles.</p>



<p>We’ve turned to the hardware experts at our sister sites <em>PCWorld</em> and <em>Macworld</em> for their recommendations on specs and models to look for. “Business and consumer laptops may be aimed at different users, but there’s a lot of overlap,” notes <em>PCWorld</em> associate editor Ashley Biancuzzo.</p>



<p>This guide concentrates on Windows systems, but in an age of workplace diversity, Apple MacBooks and Google-based Chromebooks are also represented. While they’re not as popular with IT buyers, they have their place in many modern businesses.</p>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-ai-pc-question">The AI PC question</h3>



<p>Artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (genAI), is sweeping into business operations, with Large Language Models (LLMs) helping human resource pros hone job descriptions, programmers write code, and marketers create advertising images and videos for a product launch. Many larger companies see AI as the new secret sauce to differentiate them from competitors with unique new products, more accurate sales projections, and streamlined operations.</p>



<p>With a specialized processor that contains a neural processing unit (NPU) and algorithms designed to speed up AI workloads, new AI-ready PCs can handle many of these tasks locally, thus reducing the latency, security risks, and inferencing costs associated with typical cloud-based AI operations. AI PCs are popping up in most laptop categories, though you’re not likely to find them at the budget level yet.</p>



<p>As you shop, you’ll see some laptops labeled “Copilot+ PCs.” This is Microsoft’s branding for a subset of Windows 11 AI PCs that meet or exceed certain hardware requirements, including an NPU that performs at 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a Microsoft Pluton security chip. Copilot+ PCs have exclusive access to certain AI-powered Windows features that your users may or may not find useful.</p>



<p id="look-for">As yet, however, there’s no killer app for AI PCs, and they often cost about $200 more than standard PCs, according to Gartner. That leaves IT buyers wondering if AI PCs are worth the extra investment at a time when most AI operations still take place in the cloud.</p>



<p id="look-for">Nevertheless, Gartner predicts that AI PCs will account for half of PC sales in 2026 as companies ramp up AI use — and as software vendors start to take advantage of on-device AI processing in tools such as small-language models (SLMs) for specific, tightly focused tasks. For more details and analysis, see “Should you buy AI PCs for your workforce in 2025?”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-business-laptop">What to look for in a business laptop</h3>



<p>When shopping for laptops, buyers tend to focus on the processor, along with the laptop’s size and weight. But other elements like the screen, battery, memory, and keyboard play an important part in user experience and should also be considered. </p>



<p>“For me, the key things a good, business-friendly laptop has to nail are portability, durability, and battery life,” says Biancuzzo.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at all the pieces to consider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="screen">Screen</h3>



<p>With the screen size (measured diagonally) determining the system’s overall footprint and keyboard size, most business users will be happy with 13- to 15-inch displays, which are big enough to work on comfortably but small enough to slip into a backpack or shoulder bag. For users who need more portability, screen sizes go down to 11.5 inches in mainstream and budget laptops and as small as 11 inches in tablet/laptop hybrids. At the other extreme, designers, programmers, and engineers may need the generous 17- or 18-in. displays (and extra compute power) found in mobile workstations.</p>



<p>HD resolution (1920 x 1080) is the entry ticket for most business laptops, although Wide-XGA resolution (1366 x 768) shows up on budget machines. At the other extreme, 4K (3840 x 2160) screens are increasingly popular for extra detail — a big help when designing a bridge or editing video.</p>



<p>There’s a choice between a traditional Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) that requires a backlight to get the image to the eye and an Organic Light Emitting Display (OLED) that creates its own light. While OLEDs often require a small price premium, they deliver richer and brighter imaging that can push 1,000 nits in some models, making it perfect for catching up on work while on a dark overnight flight. Nits, or candelas per square meter, are the most used measure of display brightness.</p>



<p>“I’d usually recommend a 14-inch screen with a 16:10 aspect ratio. That extra inch of vertical space makes a difference when scrolling through long documents,” Biancuzzo says. “You should also aim for at least 400 nits of brightness, especially if you work in brighter rooms.”</p>



<p>While touchscreens are <em>de rigueur</em> for tablets and 2-in-1s, they are increasingly used in traditional notebooks as well. This provides the flexibility of typing, using the touchpad, and tapping the screen. Adding a stylus can help creative types who want to draw directly on the screen.</p>



<p>While there’s no shortage of Windows 11 touchscreen notebooks, there is currently no MacBook equivalent, with Apple’s iPad tablets leading the touchscreen charge instead. There are, however, rumors of a touchscreen MacBook coming in late 2026.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="processor">Processor</h3>



<p>With the ability to manipulate data, perform calculations, and communicate across the globe, today’s processors are the Swiss Army knives of computing. The best now include a neural processing unit (NPU), which works in tandem with the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) to perform the heavy-duty matrix math required to efficiently churn through AI inference models. The alternative is to send that processing load to the cloud, which can be insecure, slow, and costly.</p>



<p>Offering a combination of traditional processing power and neural processing engines, Intel Core Ultra, AMD Ryzen AI, and Apple M4 and M5 chips can handle anything from spreadsheet work and emails to using LLMs. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series processors also have an NPU, but be aware that these Arm-based chips don’t natively run Windows apps designed for traditional X86 processors.</p>



<p>Otherwise, there are plenty of laptops across most of our categories that have less expensive chips without an NPU, such as Intel’s Core i3 and i5 lines and AMD’s Ryzen 3 and 5 lines. For example, users who only need budget systems should do fine with Intel’s N100 or Core i3 family or AMD’s Ryzen 3 processors. On the other end of the spectrum are high-powered mobile workstations equipped with an Intel Ultra 9 or Xeon server chip along with a high-performance graphics accelerator.</p>



<p>To future-proof laptop purchases, “try to stick with the latest chips like the Intel Core Ultra 7, AMD Ryzen AI, or Apple’s M4 or M5,” advises Biancuzzo. “These give you that sweet spot between speed, efficiency, and longevity. Cheaper laptops with older processors might feel fine at first, but they can start to lag faster than you’d like.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="graphics">Graphics</h3>



<p>The vast majority of laptops (and desktops, for that matter) create their video by sharing memory with the processor. The power elite use a discrete GPU with lots of independent computing cores paired with dedicated ultra-fast memory. It pays off with excellent graphics that won’t slow the system down — and the same graphics hardware can speed up local AI work. On the downside, a discrete GPU adds from $100 to several thousand dollars to the cost of a laptop, and its prodigious power use can sap battery time and heat the system up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ram">RAM</h3>



<p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is short-term data storage used for immediate processing tasks such as displaying websites, running Excel calculations, or showing CAD imaging. It comes in many sizes and speeds, and having more generally translates into better performance.</p>



<p>Users who perform basic computing tasks in non-critical roles can scrape by with 8GB of RAM, but 16GB is the entry level for most business work nowadays, and 32GB ensures that complex tasks can be done quickly and efficiently. That said, designers, engineers, and AI modelers might require 128GB or more in a mobile workstation. The good news is that RAM has never been cheaper.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="storage">Storage</h3>



<p>As old-school rotating hard drives go the way of the dinosaur, Solid State Devices (SSDs) are rapidly taking over mobile storage tasks. They’re incredibly rugged, offer quicker data access and use less power. Unfortunately, each data storage cell starts to degrade after roughly 100,000 read-write cycles, although wear levelling software can help.</p>



<p>A receptionist or intern likely wouldn’t need more than a 256GB drive, while a salesperson could require 512GB, a midlevel executive 1TB, and a designer closer to 2TB or 3TB for large files.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="keyboard-and-touchpad">Keyboard and touchpad</h3>



<p>While individual preferences vary, don’t settle for a keyboard with less than an 18mm pitch or space between keys; otherwise, the typing will be uncomfortable and inaccurate. (A good desktop keyboard has a 20 to 21mm pitch.)</p>



<p>Plus, it’s worth reading reviews of any laptop you’re considering buying to see if testers generally like the keyboard and touchpad. If you see words like “mushy” or “unresponsive,” steer clear.</p>



<p>“This is one of those things you’ll notice every single day,” says Biancuzzo. “A good keyboard beats an extra GPU or flashy feature any time. Lenovo ThinkPads are known for their great keyboards.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ports-and-connectivity">Ports and connectivity</h3>



<p>Business laptops should wirelessly connect to networks and other devices via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and also offer a variety of ports for wired connections, including multiple USB-C ports. Look for devices that support the latest standards such as Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 7, and Thunderbolt 4, but don’t overlook basics like HDMI or DisplayPort, old-school USB Type A ports, and a headphone jack.</p>



<p>“Thunderbolt/USB4 is great for high-speed gear, but most folks still appreciate the simplicity of USB-A and HDMI,” says Biancuzzo.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="webcam-and-mic">Webcam and mic</h3>



<p>“A 1080p webcam and quality microphone are essential in today’s remote work environment, especially if you’re always on Zoom,” advises Biancuzzo. While you can buy external audio/video gear, “it’s just easier when the laptop’s own camera and mic are solid. Most folks don’t bother with an external one,” she adds.</p>



<p>A nice extra is a shutter or cover for the camera to avoid inadvertent broadcasts. (That said, a piece of a Post-it note over the lens works just as well.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="battery-and-ac-adapter">Battery and AC adapter</h3>



<p>The bank of electro-chemical cells that power the laptop between charges is the rare area of unanimity among system makers, with lithium batteries the choice. They typically have a lifespan of up to 1,000 recharge cycles, which can be extended with battery optimization software that prevents overcharging.</p>



<p>You want a battery that will keep a user going for at least three to four hours before needing a recharge, but battery life is tricky to determine from a spec sheet. A mainstream laptop with a battery capacity of 50 watt-hours might last its user five hours of stop and go use on a charge, while a power-hungry mobile workstation might need 100Whr of battery capacity to last the same amount of time. As is the case with cars, your mileage will vary.</p>



<p>Here, too, reading reviews can help. “Don’t just trust the manufacturer’s claims — real-world tests matter!” says Biancuzzo. “Always check independent reviews for what you’ll actually get.”</p>



<p>A laptop’s AC adapter needs to match its power requirements, with converters ranging from 20 watts for a small iPad to about 250 watts for a mobile workstation. Increasingly, notebook makers are replacing proprietary adapters with USB-C Power Delivery, although it can take up a thin system’s only USB port.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="weight-and-durability">Weight and durability</h3>



<p>All these components add to a laptop’s heft. As you’re weighing (ha) the options, give a thought to the users who will be carrying the devices around, including where they’ll use them and with what peripherals.</p>



<p>Someone who works mostly in the office and at home — and has access to a large external monitor in both places — might prefer a lighter 13-inch model over a 15-inch one so there’s less to lug back and forth. A sales exec who’s always on the road might need that 15-inch screen, but in an ultraslim model that shaves off weight in other ways. When in doubt, ask.</p>



<p>We’ve dropped the rugged laptops category from our guide this year, because many mainstream and budget systems already meet the US military’s exacting ruggedness requirements. When shopping for systems that will be used outside an office environment, look for the MIL-STD-810H specification (a.k.a. “Mil Spec”). These devices may not be able to survive a bullet, but they can stand up to regular use and occasional abuse on the factory floor, in a first responder’s vehicle, or with utility crews.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="operating-system-manageability-and-security">Operating system, manageability, and security</h3>



<p>Windows 11 may not be perfect, but its security options are a step up from Windows 10, with a second-generation Trusted Protection Module (TPM) for ensuring authentication with the company’s servers. The OS’s Mobile Device Management (MDM) compatibility, Azure Active Directory Join, Group Policy Management, and Windows Update for Business are missing on Windows 11 Home, so IT buyers at small to midsize organizations should opt for Windows 11 Pro.</p>



<p>Large organizations get Windows 11 Enterprise (available only with a volume licensing agreement) with unified endpoint management, Windows Autopatch updates, Universal Print, and Zero Trust security options. There are three levels of Windows 11 Enterprise tuned to the needs of different organizations.</p>



<p>Apple’s macOS revolves around the system’s T2 encryption chip, XProtect for malware scanning, and GateKeeper to prevent the installation of rogue apps. Apple’s System Integrity Protection (SIP) software prevents operating system code from being changed, and the MDM code restricts users from changing key system settings.</p>



<p>The focus for Chromebooks has been on schools, but these inexpensive basic systems are also making their way into noncritical roles in corporate America. ChromeOS’s range of security apps includes Google’s Admin console with remote enrollment of new devices and locking or wiping of lost systems. It can enable updates while enforcing a company’s use of two-factor authentication.</p>



<p>Whatever platform you choose, get systems with a biometric authentication method, such as a fingerprint reader or a camera capable of facial recognition, for secure password-free logins.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="right-tool-right-job">Right tool, right job</h3>



<p>Change is the only constant here, and this effort is a snapshot in time with new models coming out weekly and prices changing quicker than you can say, “I saw it cheaper online.” To help, we’ve assigned price and component ranges to each category along with a few suggestions.</p>



<p>Be aware: the borders between the groups can be fuzzy and flexible. There are ultraslim systems that outperform mainstream notebooks and budget laptops that can be configured to cost more than mainstream ones.</p>



<p>The best way to make the correct choice is to examine what the computer will be used for and attempt to meet those requirements with the right mix of hardware, software, and online services. In other words, let the laptop fit the user, not the other way around.</p>



<p id="mainstream">And keep in mind that it’s difficult to make hardware upgrades to most notebooks. Opting for better components costs more now but can extend the useful life of a laptop, saving money later on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mainstream-laptops">Mainstream laptops</h3>



<p><strong><em>Target audience:</em></strong><em> Users who handle a variety of tasks, from working with spreadsheets to using online apps. More and more, that means having an AI assist.</em></p>



<p>Mainstream business notebooks are the workhorses of the corporate world, with the ability to perform different chores with ease. The emphasis is on flexibility and customization, and the plethora of configuration options means prices vary widely, from a modest $500 to an extravagant $2,500.</p>



<p>Often referred to as productivity systems, mainstream laptops provide the processing power and technical accoutrements to handle spreadsheet manipulation, presentation creation, sending emails, and increasingly AI-powered tasks — anything from transcribing and summarizing meetings to predicting sales by region and product to getting legal answers without a retainer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><div class="overflow-table-wrapper"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><strong>AI laptops in education:</strong> AI is becoming a vital part of training and education, offering personalized learning, automated grading, and content creation tools, according to David Childress, CTO at Louisa County Public Schools in central Virginia. AI capabilities were at the top of his wish list when he needed to replace the 500 laptops teachers and staff use at the district’s six schools.<br><br>
“AI is new and we’re early adopters. This is the future of computing and teaching,” he says.<br><br>
Childress homed in on the Acer TravelMate P6 with Intel’s AI-ready Core Ultra 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 14-in. 1920 x 1200 display, and 512GB of storage space. Powerful but light at 2.3 lbs., the systems meet the military’s strict MIL-STD-810H ruggedness spec. “The bonus is longevity. They will hopefully outlast the machines they replace,” he says.</td></tr></tbody></table> </div></figure>



<p>The latest processors available in mainstream models include AI-tuned NPUs for flying through inference models locally. In Windows systems they include Intel’s Core Ultra 5, Core Ultra 7, and Core Ultra 9 as well as AMD’s AI and AI Max CPUs. These will likely replace the Intel Core i3/i5/i7 and AMD Ryzen 5/7/9 designs in time, but for now you’ll still see plenty of mainstream models with these less expensive chips without NPUs.</p>



<p>On the Mac side, Apple’s homegrown M4 and M5 processors mix general processing with its Neural Engine, and the top M4 Max model includes fast memory access to speed its predictions. The MacBook Pro is Apple’s mainstream laptop; the 14-in. model offers the brand new M5 chip, which has a new GPU architecture with a Neural Accelerator in each of the 10 cores and faster memory access. The higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, available in both the 14-in. and 16-in. MBP models, are expected to move to the M5 architecture by next spring.</p>



<p>(Mac purchasers, take note: Other than the chip upgrade, the new M5 MacBook Pro has barely changed from the 2024 model. Major design changes are expected in the M6 MacBook Pro slated for late 2026.)</p>



<p>To get the most out of a mainstream laptop, opt for least 16GB of system RAM, with 32GB being a more comfortable level. Users who need to process large amounts of data locally, particularly for AI, or like to keep many windows open should get 64GB of RAM.</p>



<p>The center of attention is always the laptop’s screen. With sizes ranging from 11.5 to 16.2 inches, these displays should show at least 1920 x 1080 HD resolution. Many mainstream models offer a mind-numbing assortment of screen sizes and other options, such as touchscreen and non-touch surfaces and resolutions ranging up to 3820 x 2160 pixels.</p>



<p>Rotating hard drives have been replaced with lighter, more rugged, power-efficient SSDs. The options often range from 256GB (good for those who mostly work in the cloud) to 2TB (intensive local work), with 1TB being a popular compromise.</p>



<p>Because they often substitute for full desktop systems, mainstream laptops need good connections. In addition to the latest wireless specs, Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7 (a.k.a. IEEE 802.11be), look for multiple USB-C ports, USB Type A ports, and an HDMI port for external displays. For picture-perfect video calls, demand at least an HD-level (1080p) webcam.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on weight. Many of these mainstreamers, especially those with larger screens, push the envelope for heft, weighing in at up to 5 lbs. Others are significantly smaller and lighter. In other words, carrying a notebook from classroom to classroom or office to conference room doesn’t have to feel like a workout.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="budget-laptops">Budget laptops</h3>



<p><strong><em>Target audience:</em></strong><em> Workers whose daily tasks don’t require the newest, fastest, or sleekest systems.</em></p>



<p>Meant for employees who need neither the power nor the mobility of a mainstream system, budget laptops are all about compromises made in the name of cutting the cost to the bare minimum. This genre frequently leaves out things like thin designs, high-end (let alone AI-enabled) processors, lots of storage space, and high-resolution displays.</p>



<p>The biggest compromise, however, is choice, with typically just one or two versions available for each model. Look to spend between $200 and $800 for systems that might end up in the hands of a receptionist checking IDs, a room full of call center operators, or an incoming high school freshman class.</p>



<p>Windows 11 is the favorite OS in this category. While we recommend Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise for business users, large companies sometimes buy budget Windows Home systems and convert them to Pro software. Some models offer the upgrade as a license change, or the company’s IT people reimage the systems with Pro or Enterprise.</p>



<p>These devices typically come with 8GB to 16GB of RAM and a basic processor such as Intel’s N100, Celeron, Core i3 or AMD’s Ryzen 3 series. This is the only category where you’ll still find some spinning disk drives (up to 1TB), but even here SSDs (typically 64GB to 256GB) are now the norm.</p>



<p>Screen sizes range from 11 to 15 inches, and you’ll find mostly WXGA (1366 x 768) and HD (1920 x 1080) resolution. If you can afford it, a 13- or 14-inch screen in HD resolution will make your users happier, but WXGA is adequate for basic tasks.</p>



<p>Don’t count Chromebooks out. Economy is their forte, with basic designs starting at $200. With hardware stripped to the bone, configurations often start at 4GB of RAM, 32GB of SSD storage, and inexpensive Arm-based processors, like Mediatek’s Kompanio platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><div class="overflow-table-wrapper"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>
<strong>A focus on value:</strong> A.J. Sementilli, senior project and systems manager at TeamPeople, a media and staffing company, focused on value when looking for budget systems. Based in Falls Church, Virginia, TeamPeople purchased 70 Asus ChromeBook Plus CX34 systems for company technicians working at client companies. “We wanted a balance of price and performance for staff at a client,” he says.<br><br>
Equipped with a Core i5 processor, the $600 CX34 is more than powerful enough for their administrative tasks yet can deliver a full day of use per charge. “We got a good bang for our buck,” he adds.<br><br>
With a 14-in. HD screen, the CX34 weighs 3.5 lbs., yet has several mainstream luxuries, like MIL-STD-810H ruggedness. “Overall, they seem to be pretty durable,” Sementilli says. “We hope to get five years out of them.”
</td></tr></tbody></table> </div></figure>



<p>The focus on value means that budget systems are often thicker than mainstreamers, leaving room for ports including USB-C, USB Type-A, HDMI, and an audio jack.</p>



<p>Apple doesn’t have an entry in the budget category. (The closest it comes is the $1,000 entry-level MacBook Air from the ultraslim group.) There are rumors of a $600 MacBook in the works, with a 12.9 in. screen and a new A-class iPhone processor inside. It might appear in 2026 — or just be more wishful thinking from Apple fans.</p>



<p>They may not be as svelte as ultraslim systems or as powerful as mainstream ones, but budget systems have a place in most organizations.</p>



<p>> See laptop comparison chart</p>



<p id="ultraslim"><strong>Buying tip:</strong> Make sure the system will fit into the company’s IT landscape with sufficient power and security.</p>







<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ultraslim-laptops">Ultraslim laptops</h3>



<p><strong><em>Target audience:</em></strong><em> Frequent travelers and top executives who need performance without the pounds.</em></p>



<p>Think of mainstream laptops that have been given a dose of Wegovy, and you get the idea of the ultraslim category. Every effort — from design to manufacturing — has been in the name of reducing size, weight and, as the name implies, thickness. Ironically, it can lead to an airport lounge boast of “mine’s smaller.”</p>



<p>It’s all to create laptops that let users carry, not lug, a computer from city to city and conference room to conference room. The quintessential ultraslim system has a 12.5- to 15.6-in. display, is no more than half an inch thick, weighs under 2.9 lbs., and might cost between $500 on the low end and $2,500 for top performance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><div class="overflow-table-wrapper"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>
<strong>Thin but powerful:</strong> When John Berry, Director of IT Cloud Services at Simmons Bank in Little Rock, Arkansas, went looking to outfit 2,500 employees with laptops, their weight and waistline were paramount. “We wanted powerful laptops, but not at the expense of thickness and extra pounds.” At 0.6 ins. thick and 2.9 lbs., the LG Gram 15.6-in. systems he chose are thinner and lighter compared to competitors he looked at with smaller screens.<br><br>
“Simmons Bank has a cloud-first philosophy,” he adds, emphasizing that the LG Gram’s Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is just as good working AI models locally as cloud-connected. “We plan to continue that in the AI space, but the LG Gram gives us the option of mixing local and cloud AI processing.”
</td></tr></tbody></table> </div></figure>



<p>For Windows 11 systems, look for Intel’s Core Ultra processor family or AMD’s Ryzen series. This category is also the entry point for Qualcomm’s Arm-based Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite CPUs. Be careful, because some specialty corporate legacy software might not work with Arm systems, so it’s best to try out all the organization’s key apps before deployment.</p>



<p>The Apple alternative is the MacBook Air, the original ultraslim laptop. It’s powered by Apple’s Arm-based M4 processor, which combines the computing power of a 10-core processor for general everyday tasks with 16 neural processing engines available for churning through complex AI models. A new Air model with Apple’s new M5 chip inside is rumored to be coming  in spring 2026.</p>



<p>Like mainstream systems, slim laptops typically have lots of options, like HD or better screens, 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and up to a terabyte of solid-state storage space. What you often won’t find on ultraslims is lots of ports — you might get two USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI, and a headphone jack. Keep in mind that if the system charges via USB-C Power Delivery, that takes up one of your precious USB-C ports. Look for the latest communications tech, like Wi-Fi 7 and Thunderbolt 4.</p>



<p>Security is paramount, because business travelers need to log in to the company’s servers from a variety of locations, often several times a day. To start, Windows 11 requires the use of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 to securely speed authentication, while Macs have a T2 security chip that does the functional equivalent. Meanwhile, the Qualcomm Snapdragon family has TPM built in.</p>



<p>All this adds up to computers that can be expensive, running as high as $2,500 — but it’s worth it when sprinting between Gates A41 and D20 to catch the last flight home.</p>



<p>> See laptop comparison chart</p>



<p id="tablet"><strong>Buying tip:</strong> Make sure that every ounce counts with a system with powerful but lightweight components.</p>







<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tablets-and-2-in-1s">Tablets and 2-in-1s</h3>



<p><strong><em>Target audience:</em></strong><em> Those who travel light and are more oriented toward viewing content than creating it.</em></p>



<p>Tablets have evolved from entertainment devices meant for consumers into lightweight travel devices powerful enough to replace laptops for a variety of corporate roles. The essence of tablet computing is flexibility, offering a primarily touch-based experience but with a keyboard at the ready. The category is dominated by two basic designs for tablets that can double as laptops.</p>



<p><strong>2-in-1 laptops</strong>, sometimes called <strong>convertibles</strong>, have a traditional clamshell design with a twist: a 360-degree hinge lets the touch display be flipped over to create numerous configurations, from a thick tablet with the keyboard underneath to a self-standing A-frame or presentation machine for small group shows. Some outliers, like the Asus Zenbook Duo UX8406, offer two screens and a keyboard that pops off.</p>



<p>Ranging from $1,000 to $2,900, 2-in-1s generally run Windows 11 with Intel or AMD processors, including the AI-friendly Intel Core Ultra line and the AMD Ryzen AI line. About the size and weight of ultraslims, they have screens up to 16.3 in. and show from full HD (1920 x 1080) to UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution.</p>



<p><strong>Detachable devices</strong> are slate tablets with snap-on keyboards. They weigh just 1 to 2 lbs., with 10- to 14.6-in. screens at resolutions ranging from full HD up to WQXGA+ (2960 x 1848).</p>



<p>Although some of these devices are Windows 11-based, others run on Android or iPadOS. That may not be a liability for certain workers, as many workloads have shifted to the cloud and mobile apps have grown more powerful and feature-rich. And Samsung’s Android-based Galaxy Tabs have a neat trick: When plugged into a display — like a hotel TV — they can tap into Samsung’s DeX mode to get the look and feel of a desktop environment.</p>



<p>Note that there are both consumer and business versions of some popular tablet models, so be sure to get the business (or “pro”) version. For example, the Microsoft Surface Pro for Business comes with Windows 11 Pro and other enterprise security features, the Galaxy Tab S11 Series for Business builds in the company’s Knox enterprise security platform, and the Apple iPad Pro has more storage, more RAM, and a much more powerful processor than its consumer siblings. </p>



<p>Armed with the latest AI processors — such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon X / X Elite, Intel Core Ultra, AMD Ryzen AI, Apple M5, and MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ — these business-first slates typically range from $800 to $2,000 or more with all the bells and whistles. But be warned that you’ll need to supply several add-ons to make them ready for work. While some include a pull-out stand to prop it up, key accessories such as snap-on keyboards and styluses are typically sold separately and can easily add hundreds of dollars to the price.</p>



<p>[ Related reading: Does the M5-based iPad Pro change the tablet/laptop equation? ]</p>



<p>Some convertibles offer the comparative luxury of 32GB of RAM, while slates generally have between 8GB and 16GB of system memory (though some go higher). Storage starts at 256GB and tops out at 2TB, and some of these systems have surprisingly large batteries, like the 13-in. iPad Pro’s 39 watt-hour cells.</p>



<p>Port selection is limited, with just one USB-C connection for most slates, so it’s important to get adapters, cables, and sometimes a USB hub. That said, convertibles often come with several USB connections and an HDMI port for driving a display or projector.</p>



<p>> See laptop comparison chart</p>



<p id="mobile-workstation"><strong>Buying tip:</strong> Don’t forget to add accessories like the snap-on keyboard, a stylus, and any needed adapters.</p>







<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mobile-workstations">Mobile workstations</h3>



<p><strong><em>Target audience:</em></strong><em> Designers, engineers, artists and AI modelers who need the best and most powerful mobile computers.</em></p>



<p>When it comes to mobile workstations, all the careful calculations for size, weight, and battery life are replaced with a singular focus on performance, particularly for graphics. This laptop class insists on all-out performance for anything from Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) to graphics design to AI model training.</p>



<p>It starts with a heavy-duty processor, like one from the Intel Core Ultra or AMD Ryzen AI 7 Pro 350 families — or even an Intel Xeon server CPU — paired with a discrete GPU from AMD, Intel, or the current top gun, NVIDIA, with up to 10,000 independent graphics cores and 24GB of dedicated memory.</p>



<p>The Arm-based M4 Pro and M4 Max processors available in Apple’s top-of-the-line 16-in. MacBook Pro, on the other hand, neatly incorporate up to 40 GPU cores and a 16-core Neural Engine dedicated to AI work. (Mac purchasers may want to hold off for the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max processors, which are expected by spring 2026.)</p>



<p>Because graphics rule, mobile workstations generally have large screens, but in the name of portability there are 14-in. versions available. More common are 16-in. displays, and some go as big as 18-inches, with screen resolution climbing to 3840 x 2400 pixels.</p>



<p>An essential element is certification for a variety of software packages such as Autodesk (CAD), Red Digital Cinema (video editing), and Halliburton/Landmark (oil prospecting), among others. When color counts, get a screen with an .icc calibration file from the International Color Consortium. This will ensure that the special shade of yellow in a sunset photo will be spot on.</p>



<p>MacOS and Windows 11 dominate here, but there’s another alternative: some models, like Lenovo’s ThinkPad P16 Gen 2, offer Fedora or Ubuntu Linux as an option. Also note that of all the laptop categories, this one has most resisted the move to Windows 11, largely because some specialty software and drivers don’t support the new OS. The Eurocom Panther 5, for instance, is configurable with Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or even older versions of Windows.</p>



<p>These systems need to process huge files, so fill them with RAM and high-capacity SSDs; it will likely pay off later. The sky’s the limit here: you’ll find systems with up to 256GB of RAM and 16TB SSDs.</p>



<p>The bonus to being some of the biggest notebooks around is room for large, comfortable keyboards and ports for everything from USB connections, audio, and networking to HDMI or DisplayPort — sometimes both. As a result of all the aforementioned hardware — and their supersized batteries — these are the heavyweights of the laptop world, weighing from 4 to a whopping 12 lbs. In other words, consider a backpack or, better yet, a wheelie bag.</p>



<p>All these options add up, with prices starting at $2,000 and rising to as much as $10,000 for a fully loaded workstation. For systems this pricy, warranties are paramount.  Apple provides a year of coverage for the MacBook Pro, with AppleCare+ extensions costing $150 a year. Others, like HP’s ZBook workstations, are covered for three years. This should be considered the minimum but maybe also the maximum lifespan, because technology moves so quickly that a workstation could be the equivalent of a doorstop by the time the coverage expires.</p>

<p id="accessories"><strong>Buying tip:</strong> Forget about weight, size, and price — for the professionals who need these powerful systems, get the configuration necessary to get the job done.</p>







<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="time-to-accessorize">Time to accessorize</h3>



<p>You might think that getting an up-to-date laptop is deal done. It isn’t with many extras required for smooth corporate computing on the road, at the office, or at home. Here are five must-haves to consider.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Extra power.</strong> With the system’s battery hidden inside and not easily replaceable, you can’t travel with an extra set of charged cells to swap. That said, an external power bank can add hours to a system’s run time.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stand and external display.</strong> Mobility is the goal, but any business laptop will likely spend some time as a desktop computer. Getting a stand to hold it and a larger monitor to prevent squinting can help. Don’t forget the keyboard and mouse.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cables and adapters.</strong> Today, the USB-C cable can do just about anything from charging to connecting to a hotel room’s TV for a presentation. You’ll still need adapters, and don’t forget the power converter if you’re leaving the U.S.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>USB hub.</strong> With one or two USB-C ports, many laptops are hamstrung, particularly when charging. A USB hub can add several USB ports, sometimes along with wired networking, HDMI video, and old-school USB Type A connections. </li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li id="pitfalls"><strong>Bag.</strong> Get a sturdy briefcase or backpack that protects the laptop while in transit with padding, stiff plastic inserts and a slew of pockets and compartments for all the other road-worthy goodies.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="laptop-pitfalls-what-to-avoid">Laptop pitfalls: What to avoid</h3>



<p>While we spent hours defining what to include, there are several rules that should never be broken for corporate computers — mobile or stationary. Avoiding these things can not only save a lot of office anguish but maybe even a career or two.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Never (ever) get less than 8GB of RAM for a Windows or macOS system. It might be OK in a Chromebook or tablet, but this amount of system memory will likely lead to disappointing results.</li>



<li>Forget about Windows 10 — it’s history. Yes, it’s a known quantity, but its mainstream security updates have ended, unless you pay for a pricey Extended Security Updates (ESU) contract.</li>



<li>Don’t get a laptop screen with resolution less than Wide-XGA (1366 x 768 pixels). It will deliver imaging that’s second (or third) best, resulting in a potential loss of the productivity that the system is supposed to deliver.</li>



<li>Avoid cheap USB or HDMI cables that might save a few bucks up front but likely won’t work well and will disappoint users.</li>



<li>Stay away from no-name laptop brands. These systems need to last between three and five years. You likely won’t get that longevity from a brand you’ve never heard of and can’t pronounce.</li>
</ul>



<p id="comparison">Finally, don’t buy blindly. Look to reviews from reliable sources, like <em>PCWorld</em> and <em>Macworld</em>. The pros, cons, and details provided in their reviews are a solid start toward understanding if the system will fit your company’s needs.</p>
