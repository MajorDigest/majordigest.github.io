     <ul><li><strong>Harley's LiveWire drops the big bikes for small, fun stuff</strong></li><li><strong>Zero Motorcycles enters the cheap scooter market</strong></li><li><strong>Honda goes electric without the associated price tags</strong></li></ul><p>The internal combustion engine is still very much alive and well in the motorcycle industry. You only have to traipse around the halls of Milan’s annual EICMA motorcycle showcase, which has just kicked off again this year, to witness the numerous new petrol-powered models from established players <em>and</em> Chinese newcomers alike.</p><p>But just like the wider automotive industry, motorcycle brands are having to deal with increasingly stricter emissions regulations.</p><p>Take Honda for example – it's revealed an aggressive streetfighter that uses an electronically-controlled compressor in its compact engine in a bid to increase fun and reduce CO2 from the pipes.</p><p>However, many others are turning towards pure electrification to meet requirements, with brands like Yadea arguably spearheading an electric revolution in the small capacity motorcycle sector.</p><p>It now boasts a model (the Valex) that can replenish batteries up to 80% in just 20 minutes and is almost single-handedly convincing those parts of the world that rely on the humble scooter to make the switch.</p><p>This year’s show wasn’t exactly packed to the gunwales with stunning new EV offerings – perhaps as a reaction to the relatively slow uptake in the Western World — but EICMA still acts as platform for the freshest two-wheeled tech.</p><p>Here’s a hand-selection of the most exciting things from EICMA 2025…</p><h3 id="1-honda-wn7-2">1. Honda WN7</h3><p>Alongside its dabbling with electronically-controlled compressors (yeah, we don’t understand it either), Honda also took the wraps off the production version of the WN7 – the marque’s first, full-sized electric motorcycle.</p><p>It’s heavily based on the EV Fun Concept from last year, but this production version develops a peak power of either 67bhp or 15bhp depending on the license held by the rider and local laws.</p><p>Top speed is tipped to be around 80mph, although it can cover 50 meters from standstill in just 3.9 seconds. A slightly odd metric, but it’s designed to showcase the near-instantaneous torque on offer.</p><p>Prices in the UK are said to be £12,999 (around $17,000 / AU$26,000), which is in line with much of Honda’s petrol-powered line-up and undercuts many similarly-sized rivals from the likes of Zero and Verge, for example.</p><p>Its range is said to be around 87 miles, with the 9.3kWh lithium-ion battery capable of a 20-80% charge in 30 minutes when using a CCS2 fast charger.</p><p>It’s a highly competitive all-electric offering from an established brand that, if marketed properly in the right regions, could prove a big hit with buyers intrigued by electric propulsion.</p><h3 id="2-zero-ls1-2">2. Zero LS1</h3><p>Not long after revealing the XE and XB line of simple, off-road motorcycles, Zero Motorcycles is looking to bolster its reputation as an electric motorcycle leader with the reveal off its debut battery-powered scooter.</p><p>Costing £4,500 (around $6,000 / AU$9,000), the LS1 is capable of tickling 62mph and traveling for around 72 miles on a single charge.</p><p>Like the Honda CUV:e we rode earlier this year, it can be legally owned and ridden on entry-level licenses, making it a boon for commuters looking to ditch the trains.</p><p>Zero says the LS1 can be specified with under-seat storage or an optional third battery that increases range to an impressive 108 miles.</p><p>Said batteries are swappable and, like the previously mentioned Honda and BMW CE02, can be charged away from the bike.</p><h3 id="3-royal-enfield-flying-flea-ff-s6-2">3. Royal Enfield Flying Flea FF.S6</h3><p>Royal Enfield shocked and slightly confused the world when it said it would resurrect an old World War 2 model (originally deigned to be parachuted out of a plane) as a futuristic, all-electric city slicker.</p><p>Last year’s Flying Flea concept divided opinion, as it looked, well, a bit weird. As a result,  the company has hit back with a more conventional scrambler, replete with the beefed-up front forks, mudguards and a flat seat.</p><p>Despite the easier-to-swallow styling, the second iteration of Flying Flea still packs a hefty technological punch, with a motorcycle-specific Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and uninterrupted connectivity via built-in 4G.</p><p>This effectively makes it a Software Defined Vehicle, with the ability to upgrade software and add more features over time… like a Tesla.</p><p>The tech also powers a voice assistant that allows for easy hands-free control of a connected smartphone and the built-in navigation.</p><p>There is still no word on what these will cost, how long they take to charge or the expected range, but it would be at odds with Royal Enfield’s reputation for excellent value to manufacture production models with eye-watering price tags.</p><h3 id="4-verge-ts-pro-2">4. Verge TS Pro</h3><p>We rode the Verge TS earlier this year and we were impressed by the performance offered by that rear hub motor, but the very expensive machine still felt like a prototype. It required a little more polish.</p><p>Well, Verge has hit back with a new TS Pro version that features the latest Donut Motor 2.0 from sister company Donut Labs, which is claimed to be 50% lighter than its predecessor, while still delivering that gut-busting 1,000Nm of torque.</p><p>Range has also increased to an astonishing 350km (217 miles) and it’s possible to top up the built-in batteries in around 35-minutes from a fast charger.</p><p>The brand’s Starmatter infotainment system takes pride of place in the cockpit, offering video game-level graphics, constant connectivity and the ability to update features over-the-air.</p><p>Pricing is still to be determined, but the TS we rode cost $29,900 / £31,980 (around AU$46,000). We imagine the Pro, with its improved motor, larger batteries and fancy infotainment system, will cost even more. <em>Ouchie</em>.</p><h3 id="5-livewire-s4-honcho-2">5. LiveWire S4 Honcho</h3><p>This cheeky little Monkey bike-a-like was first teased at a Harley-Davidson event earlier this year, but LiveWire (Harley’s electric sub brand) has confirmed the S4 Honcho will go into production in 2026, unveiling a version at EICMA 2025.</p><p>Designed for "errands, backroads and everything in-between," the diminutive runaround comes in either a Street or Trail configuration, with the latter not requiring a license in most markets, meaning it can be enjoyed by anyone with a bit of private land to thrash it on.</p><p>The simple trellis frame and tiny wheels evoke memories of the original Honda Monkey machines, while the removable battery packs and punchy electric motors give it a decidedly modern twist.</p><p>Come on, how good does that Trail version look?</p><p><em></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.
