<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is AIOps? AIOps, defined</strong></h3>



<p>AIOps — short for <em>AI for IT operations </em>— is an emerging operational practice that uses machine learning and automation to help organizations monitor, manage, and troubleshoot complex digital systems. Companies that implement AIOps use AI-driven tools to combine data from logs, metrics, and events across infrastructure and applications to detect problems early, identify root causes, and trigger responses before users even notice an issue.</p>



<p>AIOps has been around since before the current wave of generative AI, taking its name from the sense of AI/ML more common in the last decade. Monika Malik, lead data/AI engineer at AT&amp;T, describes that era’s model as straightforward: “ingest → correlations → detect anecdotal events → predict root likely cause → orchestrate some remediation.”</p>



<p>That workflow still forms the backbone of AIOps today, she says, but large language models are adding a new layer of intelligence. “GenAI is additive, not a replacement,” she says. “LLMs sit atop reasoning/summarization, ops copilots, and knowledge retrieval—but data plus rules plus ML still needs to exist.”</p>



<p>In short, AIOps began as a way to automate IT operations through analytics and machine learning. Today, generative AI is enhancing that foundation with conversational interfaces and contextual reasoning, helping teams work faster and boosting cloud and IT operations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AIOps vs. devops: What’s the difference?</strong></h3>



<p>Devops and AIOps share some philosophical DNA — both are about bringing automation, feedback loops, and responsiveness to technology systems — but they operate at different levels of the stack.</p>



<p>As Kostas Pardalis, data infrastructure engineer and co-founder of Typedef, puts it, “Devops is about automating and streamlining the software development lifecycle. AIOps extends that philosophy into operations by applying machine learning and inference as first-class operations.” In other words: devops helps you ship and deploy reliably and quickly; AIOps helps you monitor, detect, and remediate in production more intelligently.</p>



<p>Greg Ingino, CTO of Litera, frames the two as complementary: devops governs how we build and deliver systems, while “AIOps governs how we operate and optimize those systems in production. Devops drives speed, while AIOps ensures stability.”</p>



<p>In practice, you can think of devops as the foundation of continuous delivery and infrastructure automation, and AIOps as adding a layer of smart monitoring and autonomous operations. Over time, as systems grow increasingly complex, that added intelligence becomes essential to keeping environments resilient, especially at scale.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the components of an AIOps platform?</strong></h3>



<p>Typedef’s Pardalis explains that an AIOps platform needs three layers. Start with “data collection and normalization across logs, metrics, traces, and unstructured events,” he says. Next comes “inference-first pipelines that can classify, enrich, and correlate signals probabilistically, not just deterministically. Finally, you need “observability and governance, so teams can trust the AI outputs —  lineage, evaluations, cost controls. Without those, you either drown in data or end up with a black box no one trusts.”</p>



<p>Milankumar Rana, software engineer advisor and senior cloud engineer at FedEx, lays out a more detailed architecture that blends traditional observability with generative intelligence. He notes that many deployments rely on open-source stacks such as ELK, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry, while commercial tools like Splunk, Elastic Observability, LogicMonitor, and IBM’s AIOps suite add “generative AI for natural language query, incident summarization, and autonomous remediation.” Cloud providers have joined in too, with AWS and Azure adding AIOps-powered incident insights and anomaly detection.</p>



<p>According to Rana, “any AIOps platform has interconnected parts”: data ingestion and normalization; scalable analytics stores; ML models that predict and correlate incidents; and newer generative layers that summarize events and suggest next actions. Noise reduction, feedback loops, visualization dashboards, and strong governance complete the picture. Few organizations implement every component, but these elements together define what a trustworthy AIOps system looks like.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AIOps implementation strategies</strong></h3>



<p>A carefully considered AIOps rollout rarely starts with a grand sweep—instead, success comes from incremental steps, measurable wins, and building trust. AT&amp;T’s Malik recommends the following steps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Start thin:</strong> Pick two or three chronically noisy services and define success criteria—for example, 30% less noise, 20% faster MTTR.</li>



<li><strong>Hybrid detection:</strong> Combine hard rules for SLO breaches with ML-based anomaly detection. Avoid going “pure ML” too early.</li>



<li><strong>Make explainability visible:</strong> Every dashboard or prompt should show <em>why</em> something is being brought to the attention of the user—similar past incidents, knowledge-base references, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Phase in automation:</strong> Begin with read-only insights, then allow the system to begin suggesting actions with human approval, and then move on to limited auto-execute (with rollback protection).</li>



<li><strong>Measure and publish weekly:</strong> Track metrics like MTTA/MTTR, false positives, L1 deflection, and on-call hours saved.</li>
</ul>



<p>FedEx’s Rana emphasizes that many successful adopters first conduct a “data readiness examination” to expose issues like excessive false positives that intelligent automation can help mitigate. He calls for a domain-specific proof of concept that boosts confidence, surfaces data quality gaps, and enables incremental evolution of services, telemetry, and automation. He also warns that “autonomous systems without audit trails or rollback need safety and governance,” and stresses that educating AI users and ops teams is as essential as deploying new tools.</p>



<p>Litera’s Ingino echoes the “start small, prove value” ethos: his team began with a single product line to reduce alert noise and improve MTTR, won early buy-in, and then expanded AIOps across environments. “Our engineers saw early wins, and that built confidence,” he says. He notes that the key is trust — making AIOps a reliable partner rather than an experiment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits and challenges with AIOps rollouts</strong></h3>



<p>When AIOps works, its advantages are immediate and measurable. Ingino says that at Litera, the payoff has been “faster incident detection, fewer false alarms, and greater system reliability.” Beyond improving uptime, he notes that “AIOps has significantly reduced the cognitive load on our operations teams, allowing them to focus on higher-value engineering work.”</p>



<p>Nagmani Lnu, director of quality engineering at SWBC, agrees that the biggest benefits come from earlier, more accurate detection and resolution. When AIOps is implemented successfully, he says, “the company will really see benefits in detecting issues proactively and addressing them in real time, and will improve their MTTR and hence improve the IT experience for the business.” Typedef’s Pardalis adds that AIOps provides “the ability to handle scale that humans simply can’t,” turning mountains of telemetry into actionable insight.</p>



<p>The challenges, however, can be as significant as the rewards. Ingino says the hardest problems are “data quality and cultural change.” AIOps “is only as smart as the data it sees,” he explains, so ensuring consistent, contextual ingestion is critical. Trust is another recurring theme. “Teams need to trust the AI,” Pardalis warns. “That means transparency, lineage, and the ability to debug.” He also points to practical barriers—“models are probabilistic, so you need guardrails,” and “costs can spike if you don’t optimize inference.” Lnu adds that poor use-case selection can derail an entire rollout: “Poor selection can deter management confidence and hence risk any future innovation.”</p>



<aside class="sidebar">
<h3><strong> Best AIOps tools </strong></h3>
> The AIOps market today spans both legacy observability platforms and AI-native frameworks built for inference-first workloads. Typedef’s Pardalis explains: “Legacy observability vendors like Datadog, Splunk, and New Relic are layering AI on top of their platforms. Then there are AI-native frameworks—things like Typedef or open-source stacks like Ray and Polars—that let you operationalize inference directly inside your data pipelines.” </p>
> The right choice, he adds, depends on whether a company wants incremental AI added to existing monitoring or a ground-up, inference-driven architecture.
SWBC’s Lnu notes that “most AIOps platforms have very similar capabilities,” but cites “Dynatrace, Splunk, Datadog, New Relic, [and] BigPanda” as consistent leaders. He says the best choice depends on “needs and budget,” as well as AI maturity and infrastructure readiness.
</p>
</aside><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the role of an AIOps engineer?</strong></h3>



<p>An AIOps engineer takes on an interdisciplinary role, combining the skills of a site reliability engineer, a data scientist, and an automation specialist. Typedef’s Pardalis describes the job as “an evolution of the site reliability engineer. An AIOps engineer isn’t just automating playbooks,” he says. “They’re designing pipelines where inference is in the loop.” That includes “curating data for observability, training or fine-tuning models for anomaly detection, and deploying inference-first workflows that make sense of logs, traces, and metrics in real time.”</p>



<p>Chirag Agrawal, lead engineer and tech expert, emphasizes that while some think of an AIOps engineer as a mere tool configuration tech, their real impact lies in understanding, managing, and curating the data that AIOps tools will make use of. “When poor-quality data is ingested, poor outcomes are produced,” he says, adding that the best AIOps engineers are those with “deep understanding of logs, metrics, and dependencies specific to their environments,” not necessarily formal AI backgrounds.</p>



<p>SWBC’s Lnu frames the role more systematically. An AIOps engineer’s responsibilities, he says, include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Defining objectives and scope</strong>, identifying pain points like alert fatigue or performance bottlenecks and setting success metrics such as reduced MTTR.</li>



<li><strong>Assessing the current IT environment</strong>, from servers and containers to monitoring tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana.</li>



<li><strong>Creating a data strategy</strong>, ensuring standardized, enriched, and centralized telemetry.</li>



<li><strong>Selecting the right AIOps platform</strong>, evaluating integration capabilities and AI/ML features.</li>



<li><strong>Developing automation playbooks</strong>, from restarting instances to triggering service tickets or scaling workloads via orchestration tools.</li>
</ul>



<p>The AIOps engineer is a bridge between human operators and intelligent systems—someone who not only builds automation but also instills trust, establishes governance, and offers insight into how AI makes operational decisions.</p>

<h3><strong>Gen AI prompt patterns for DevOps</strong></h3>
> AT&amp;T’s Malik shared examples of how her team uses carefully designed generative AI prompts to support AIOps tasks in production. Each prompt sits on top of retrieval systems (pulling from runbooks, past incidents, and standard operating procedures) and interacts only with approved tools—no open-ended code execution or shell commands. Malik emphasizes that every prompt enforces strict confidence, sourcing, and refusal rules to keep automation explainable and auditable.</p>
> Below are abbreviated samples of the kinds of prompts her team uses: </p>
> Incident Summarizer (for on-call handoff) </p>

<pre>SYSTEM: You are an Ops Incident Summarizer. Use ONLY retrieved artifacts and telemetry snippets.  
RULES:  
- Summarize in ≤150 words with bullet points.  
- Include: symptom, blast radius, last change, probable cause candidates, next-best action.  
- Cite sources [KB#:line] and telemetry [panel:timestamp].  
- If sources are insufficient, say "Insufficient evidence" and STOP. 
USER: Summarize Incident {INC_ID}. Retrieve from {KB_SCOPE} and {TELEMETRY_SCOPE}.
</pre> 

> RCA Assistant (evidence-weighted)</p>
<pre>SYSTEM: You produce evidence-weighted RCA candidates.  
RULES:  
- Output top 3 hypotheses with likelihood scores (0–1), each tied to evidence.  
- List disconfirming evidence if present.  
- Suggest 1–3 tests to validate quickly.  
- No action execution.  

USER: Given metrics/logs/traces for {SERVICE}, generate RCA candidates.</pre>
> <strong>Runbook Recommender (human-in-the-loop)</strong>
</p><pre>SYSTEM: Propose runbooks only from ALLOWLIST. Require explicit human approval.  
RULES:  
- Output: (a) Runbook ID, (b) Preconditions satisfied? (Y/N), (c) Risk (L/M/H), (d) Estimated blast radius.  
- Block if preconditions fail.  

USER: Recommend safe next step for incident {INC_ID}.
</pre>
> <strong>Post-Mortem Drafter (with citations)</strong></p>
<pre>SYSTEM: Draft a concise post-mortem with sections: Timeline, Root Cause, Impact, Detection, Response, What Went Well, Improvements.  
RULES:  
- Every claim must cite [artifact ID].  
- Flag unknowns as TODO.  

USER: Draft post-mortem for incident {INC_ID}.
</pre>
> She notes that her team keeps a number of guardrails in place across all prompts:
</p><ul>
 <li>Retrieval-first approach; no direct model “knowledge.”</li>
 <li>Tool use limited to queries or knowledge bases—never production changes.</li>
 <li>Confidence thresholds trigger refusal below minimum certainty. </li>
 <li>Every output includes a “Sources” section for audit. </li>
 <li>Human approval required for any action that could affect production systems. </li>
</ul>

</aside><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Real-world AIOps examples</strong></h3>



<p>AIOps is increasingly proving its value in production environments across industries—from cloud-native infrastructure to publishing and cybersecurity. SWBC’s Lnu says real-world deployments vary by environment. In cloud-native contexts, organizations use AIOps to “monitor container health, detecting abnormal CPU, memory, or network usage across containers,” and to “predict high traffic periods to pre-warm Lambda functions to avoid cold start latency.” Other use cases include “auto-scaling ECS tasks based on historical load, controlling cost by limiting over-provisioned containers, and predicting EC2 instance failure before they crash.” The same systems can automatically “reboot, replace, or resize” affected instances, helping reduce downtime while optimizing spend.</p>



<p>Chirag Agrawal offers a people-focused success story. His team developed “an AI agent that recognized tickets commonly reassigned between teams. The tickets were automatically routed correctly without requiring any human intervention.” The result: hundreds of hours saved per quarter and a clear ROI. Agrawal attributes that success to groundwork—“years of carefully studying, cleaning, and labeling historical data”—and emphasizes that “the model wasn’t simply left to run on raw data; it was trained under human supervision.”</p>



<p>Typedef’s Pardalis has seen similar gains in other sectors. “Media companies use AI pipelines to classify and enrich thousands of documents daily,” he says, while cybersecurity teams “use inference to extract structure from unstructured logs, enabling faster threat detection without drowning analysts in alerts.”</p>



<p>Litera’s Ingino recounts a scenario where AIOps tools detected “a subtle performance drift in a service that standard monitoring would have otherwise missed.” The platform “correlated anomalies across several microservices, pinpointed the source, and triggered a response before users experienced any degradation.” That single event, he says, “validated the entire investment.” Since then, Litera has seen “incident resolution times drop by more than 70%,” with PagerDuty automation ensuring the right engineers engage immediately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are humans still needed in an AIOps world?</strong></h3>



<p>Even as AIOps grows more capable—correlating events, summarizing incidents, and recommending fixes—human expertise remains essential. Chirag Agrawal puts it plainly: “AI can automate pattern recognition, but context and intent must be provided by people who understand how those systems behave in real-world environments.”</p>



<p>AIOps excels at sifting through telemetry, detecting anomalies, and accelerating root-cause analysis, but it still depends on human judgment to interpret meaning, verify impact, and decide how automation should evolve. “AIOps works best when human insight and machine intelligence are developed side by side, not when one replaces the other,” Agrawal says.</p>



<p>That partnership also fuels long-term progress. Every resolved incident strengthens the system’s knowledge base, improving future responses and reducing toil. “The true promise of AIOps,” Agrawal concludes, “is seen not only in automation but in the collective memory that is built.”</p>



<p>In that sense, AIOps doesn’t make humans obsolete—it amplifies them. The more context engineers share with these systems, the better they become at turning raw data into operational intelligence.</p>
