    <p>Some spouses of foreign workers on the controversial H-1B visa may lose their work permits after the Trump administration changed employment rules.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Oct. 30 stripped holders of the H-4 spousal visa &#8212; thousands of whom are estimated to live and work in the Bay Area &#8212; of the ability to receive automatic extensions for their work permits when their renewal applications have been submitted but not fully processed by immigration authorities.</p>
<p>Previously, foreign citizens on the H-4 and certain other visas could have their work permits automatically extended by 540 days if their permit applications were submitted on time but expired while still being processed.</p>
<p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow, announcing the rule change, said his agency was placing renewed emphasis on &#8220;screening and vetting&#8221; foreign citizens, &#8220;eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security.&#8221;</p>

<p>The agency, which handles employment authorization renewals, said its current processing time is four months in 80% of cases. But immigration experts said the agency will likely take longer than that in certain cases. And because visa holders can only apply for work permits a maximum of six months in advance, some H-4 holders may not get their permits re-approved before they expire. Foreign workers must immediately stop working if their employment authorizations lapse.</p>
<p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Friday that gaps in employment could result if visa holders don&#8217;t file work permit applications in time, or if the agency can&#8217;t process their applications before permits expire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me,&#8221; said Kelli Duehning, a partner in the BAL immigration law firm’s San Francisco office who spent 17 years as a lawyer for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do whatever screening you need. But then don&#8217;t penalize the person who is here on a valid status that you granted them and then not allow them to work because the administration is taking more time to do that vetting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kalpana Peddibhotla, executive director of the San Jose-based South Asian American Justice Collaborative, said the change for now may affect only a &#8220;narrow set&#8221; of H-4 holders, but &#8220;processing times will likely go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peddibhotla noted that H-4 holders have already gone through extensive security checks to be allowed into the U.S.</p>
<p>Vetting and screening will probably include checks for any criminal activity, and probing of applicant&#8217;s social media for sentiments viewed by the administration of President Donald Trump as &#8220;anti-American&#8221; under one of the president&#8217;s executive memoranda, Duehning said. She said she would not be surprised if that screening led to denials of work permits.</p>
<p>The additional investigation will probably add to processing times for H-4 work permits, Duehning said.</p>
<p>Citizenship and Immigration did not immediately respond to questions about the screening and vetting.</p>
<p>About 90,000 foreign citizens live in the U.S. under the H-4 visa, which is granted to wives and husbands of H-1B workers on track for a green card. The vast majority of H-4 holders are women from India. Since 2015, they&#8217;ve been allowed to work if their spouses on the H-1B &#8212; a visa heavily used by the Silicon Valley technology industry to obtain top talent along with lower-paid employees &#8212; are on track for a green card.</p>
<p>Losing work authorization can cost a foreign worker their job, and make it harder to find other employment in the future, Peddibhotla said. Taking away automatic renewal also dissuades employers from offering jobs to H-4 holders out of concerns about potential employment gaps, Peddibhotla added.</p>
<p>People on the H-4 have long faced uncertainty over their ability to take and keep jobs. Two months after they received the right to work under former President Barack Obama in 2015, a group of tech workers sued the federal government, claiming the employment authorization illegally and unfairly forced them to compete for jobs against non-citizens.</p>
<p>While President Donald Trump was campaigning for his first term in the White House, he attacked the H-1B and claimed an “influx of foreign workers” was hurting working-class Americans. In the first year in office, his administration pledged to end the H-4 employment authorization, sparking a lobbying blitz by the tech industry, which highlighted companies’ reliance on H-1B workers and argued that allowing H-1B spouses to work was crucial for attracting and retaining foreign talent. The work ban never came.</p>
<p>In Trump&#8217;s second term, the H-1B shot to its highest-ever profile in America&#8217;s debate over immigration and foreign workers, after a right-wing conspiracy theorist attacked  employment of Indian tech workers in the U.S. The ensuing vitriolic debate exposed a schism among Trump supporters, pitting advocates for the tech sector and Silicon Valley against anti-immigration hardliners.</p>
<p>In October, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the tech workers&#8217; H-4 case, effectively ending it.</p>
<p>Duehning recalled that processing backlogs for H-4 visas and work permits in 2019 and 2020 caused substantial upheaval in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The impact is more prevalent here in the Bay Area because of the large volumes of H-4 holders that we have here, and also because of the cost of living,&#8221; Duehning said. &#8220;It is very difficult when you have only one working adult in the household. It really puts a lot of these families in a really bad spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>If H-4 work permit processing times increase past six months, Duehning said, &#8220;I think we will start seeing a lot of concern. It will really put a lot of families here in a position of &#8216;Hey, can we even afford to be here?'&#8221;</p>
