<p>Generative AI is a kind of artificial intelligence that creates new content, including text, images, audio, and video, based on patterns it has learned from existing data.</p>



<p>Today’s generative models are typically built on foundation-model architectures such as large-language models (LLMs) and multimodal systems, enabling them to carry on conversations, answer questions, write stories, generate code, and produce images or videos from brief prompts.</p>



<p><em>Generative AI</em> is different from <em>discriminative AI</em>, which draws distinctions between different kinds of input. Where discriminative AI answers questions like “Is this image of a rabbit or a lion?”, generative AI instead responds to prompts such as “Describe to me how a rabbit and lion look different from one another” or “Draw me a picture of a lion and a rabbit sitting next to each other” — and in both cases produces text or imagery that, while grounded in the AI’s training data, isn’t just a copy of something that already existed.</p>

<h3>[ <u>Read next: Large language models: The foundations of generative AI</u> ]</h3>
</aside>




<p>Just a few years ago, generative AI was once a novelty focused on chatbots and artistic image generation. Today, it has become a core enterprise technology, and powers everything from content creation and software development to customer support and analytics workflows. But with that power comes a new set of challenges — from model alignment and hallucination to governance and data-integration hurdles.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll look at how generative AI works, explore how it has evolved into the foundation-model era, examine how to implement it effectively, and offer best practices for getting value out of it, today and in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does generative AI work?</strong></h3>



<p>For decades, early artificial-intelligence efforts often focused on rule-based systems or narrowly trained models that were built for one task at a time. While these efforts produced useful systems that could reason and solve human tasks, they were generally a far cry from sci-fi visions of thinking machines. Programs that could talk to people never seemed to get very far past the level of ELIZA, a “computer therapist” created at MIT in the mid 1960s; even Siri and Alexa after much fanfare were revealed to be fairly limited.</p>



<p>The big structural shift that gave birth to modern generative AI came with the concept of a <em>transformer, </em>first introduced in “Attention Is All You Need,” a 2017 paper from Google researchers.</p>



<p>Using a transformer architecture as a basis, you can build a system that derives meaning from analyzing long sequences of input <em>tokens</em> (words, sub-words, bytes) to understand how different tokens might be related to one another, then determines how likely any given token is to come next in a sequence, given the others. In AI lingo, we call these systems <em>models.</em> Because a model analyzes very large datasets and parameter counts, it can pick up on statistical patterns and knowledge implicitly embedded in the data.</p>



<p>This is all easier said than done. The process of adjusting a model’s internal parameters so it gets better at predicting the next token in sequences is called <em>training</em>. During training, the model repeatedly guesses the next token in a given sequence, compares its prediction to the actual one, measures the error, and updates its parameters to reduce that error across billions of examples. Over time, that process teaches the model the statistical relationships that will allow it to generate coherent language (or code, or images) later.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a foundation model?</strong></h3>



<p>You’ll often hear the word <em>large</em> used for transformer-based models of these types, like the LLMs we mentioned earlier. <em>Large</em> in this context refers to the large number of internal numerical values that the model adjusts during training to represent what it has learned, along with breadth and diversity of data used to train the model and the underlying compute resources powering this whole process.</p>



<p>This is in contrast with the narrow models of the earlier era of AI/ML, which werebuilt for one purpose and trained on a limited dataset. For instance, a spam filter may be very good at what it does, but it’s only trained on email data and all it can do is classify emails. Large models, by contrast, serve as what’s known as <em>foundation models</em>. They’re trained broadly on diverse data (text, code, images, or multimodal data) and then adapted or specialized for many downstream tasks.</p>



<p>These foundation models are the basis for most of the popular generative AI tools and services on the market today. They can be specialized in several ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> Giving a foundation model further training on a smaller, task-specific dataset</li>



<li><strong>Retrieval-augmented generation</strong> <strong>(RAG):</strong> Giving the model the ability to pull in external knowledge when asked a question</li>



<li> <strong>Prompt engineering</strong>: Tailoring a query so the model gives the sort of answers you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do AI systems write computer code?</strong></h3>



<p>One of the surprising discoveries of the gen AI era was that in recent years was that foundation models trained on natural-language text can also, when fine-tuned with code examples, also write computer code — often better than many purpose-built systems. Still, it makes sense, when you think about it — after all, high-level computer languages are designed by humans and ultimately based on human language.</p>



<p>This 2023 InfoWorld article highlights how models like PaLM, LLaMA and other transformer-based systems fine-tuned on code repositories propelled this shift, but since AI giants like OpenAI have moved into this space. This all matters because code generation (or code-assisted productivity) has become a key enterprise use case of generative AI — perhaps <em>the </em>key use, given the industry’s enthusiastic adoption of it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are AI agents?</strong></h3>



<p>So far, we’ve been talking about chatbots, writing assistants, image-generation tools. They respond to prompts, output text or images, and then stop. A new category of tool called <em>agentic AI</em> goes further: it <em>plans</em>, <em>executes</em>, and in many cases <em>learns</em> as it works.</p>



<p>Because large models already understand language, code, and even structured data to some extent, they can be repurposed to generate not only descriptive text but <em>operational instructions</em>. For example: an agent might parse the intent “generate a sales-report”, then format internal calls like getData(salesDB, region=NA, period=lastQuarter), and then call an API, all by generating text that’s interpreted as instructions. The MCP framework standardizes the “language” of those instructions and the plug-points into tools and data so that the model doesn’t need bespoke integrations for each new workflow.</p>



<p>These kinds of autonomous agents have several enterprise use cases:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Software automation</strong>: Agents that generate code, call unit tests, deploy builds, monitor logs and even roll back changes autonomously.</li>



<li><strong>Customer support</strong>: Instead of simply drafting responses, agents interact with CRM APIs, update ticket statuses, escalate issues, and trigger follow-up workflows.</li>



<li><strong>IT operations/AIOps</strong>: Agents monitor infrastructure, identify anomalies, open/close tickets, or auto-remediate based on defined rules and context from logs.</li>



<li><strong>Security</strong>: Agents may detect threats, initiate alerts, isolate compromised systems, or even attempt to manage threat containment — though this raises new risks.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can you implement generative AI in the enterprise?</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve now touched on <em>what</em> generative AI can do. But <em>how</em> can you make it work reliably in your business. The difference between a pilot and full-scale deployment often comes down to systems, structure and governance as much as to models themselves. <em>InfoWorld’</em>s Matt Asay offers a deep dive into enterprise gen AI essentials, but here are some important points to keep in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Choosing between API, open-source or custom fine-tuned models. </strong>One of the first major decisions for any enterprise project is: do you use a model via an API (e.g., from a vendor like OpenAI or Anthropic), deploy an open-source model internally, or build/fine-tune a custom model yourself? Each has trade-offs.</p>



<p>APIs offer speed and minimal setup, but may expose data, limit customization or accrue high cost — and will leave you at the mercy of your vendor. Open source allows internal control and may ease fine-tuning, but requires infrastructure, expertise, and support. Custom fine-tuning gives you the tightest alignment to your use-case, but lengthens time to value and increases risk.</p>



<p><strong>Governance, data privacy and compliance. </strong>Deploying generative AI in an enterprise setting raises new governance, privacy and regulatory issues. For example: Who owns the data that’s ingested? How is proprietary data protected if you call a third-party API? What traceability exists for model outputs—a huge question for regulated industries? One useful framework is covered in “A GRC framework for securing generative AI” Data governance must adapt for the new era,  and new frameworks are evolving to help.</p>



<p><strong>Human-in-the-loop review. </strong>Even the best models make mistakes and cannot simply be put on autopilot. You need a <em>human-in-the-loop (HITL)</em> process: real people need to review outputs, validate for bias, approve high-stakes content, and tune prompts or models based on feedback. Incorporating HITL checkpoints helps mitigate risk and improve overall quality.</p>



<p><strong>Integration with existing systems and RAG pipelines. </strong>Retrieval-augmented generation, which we touched on earlier, connects foundation models into business workflows, systems, and enterprise data stores. RAG can bind LLMs to your organization’s internal knowledge bases, thereby reducing <em>hallucinations </em>(which we’ll discuss in a moment) and increasing the relevance of gen AI output.</p>



<aside class="sidebar">
<h3><strong> Implementation best practices for generative AI</strong></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Here are four AI best practices to keep in mind:</p>
<ol style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
<li> Guardrails: Define clear operational boundaries. Examples: restrict sensitive data output, enforce access controls, log model interactions.</li>
<li> Prompt engineering: Because much of what the model will do depends on how it’s prompted, invest in prompt design, versioning, review, and testing.</li>
<li> Evaluation metrics: Define appropriate KPIs (accuracy, latency, cost, business outcome), monitor them and iterate.</li>
<li> Model observability: Treat generative-AI systems like software — monitor performance, detect drift, handle failures gracefully, audit outputs and maintain traceability.</li>
</ol>
</aside>




<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What causes AI hallucinations?</strong></h3>



<p>Probably the biggest limitation of generative AI is what those in the industry call <em>hallucinations</em>, which is a perhaps misleading term for output that is, by the standards of humans who use it, false or incorrect.  </p>



<p>Every generative AI system, no matter how advanced, is built around prediction. Remember, a model doesn’t truly <em>know</em> facts—it looks at a series of tokens, then calculates, based on analysis of its underlying training data, what token is most likely to come next. This is what makes the output fluent and human-like, but if its prediction is wrong, that will be perceived as a hallucination.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>Because the model doesn’t distinguish between something that’s known to be true and something likely to follow on from the input text it’s been given, hallucinations are a direct side effect of the statistical process that powers generative AI. And don’t forget that we’re often pushing AI models to come up with answers to questions that we, who also have access to that data, can’t answer ourselves.</p>



<p>In text models, hallucinations might mean inventing quotes, fabricating references, or misrepresenting a technical process. In code or data analysis, it can produce syntactically correct but logically wrong results. Even RAG pipelines, which provide real data context to models, only <em>reduce</em> hallucination—they don’t eliminate it. Enterprises using generative AI need review layers, validation pipelines, and human oversight to prevent these failures from spreading into production systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are some other problems with generative AI?</strong></h3>



<p>Generative AI has proven to be such a disruptive technology that’s stoking near-apocalyptic fears that it will result in a superintelligence that will enslave or destroy humanity. Meanwhile, in the present day, increasingly troubling reports of so-called AI psychosis are emerging, where people have mental health episodes triggered by the uncanny and sometimes sycophantic ways chatbots affirm whatever you talk to them about and try to keep the conversation going.</p>



<p>Compared to such existential questions, the following business-related problems may seem petty. But they’re real issues for enterprises considering investing in AI tools.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data leakage and regulatory risk. </strong>When a model is fine-tuned or prompted with sensitive information, that data may be memorized and unintentionally reproduced. Using third-party APIs without strict controls can expose proprietary or personally identifiable information (PII). Regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA require explicit governance around where training data resides and how inference results are stored.</li>



<li><strong>Prompt injection </strong>occurs when an attacker manipulates a model’s instructions—embedding hidden directives or malicious payloads in user input or external content the model reads. This can override safety rules, expose internal data, or execute unintended actions in agentic systems. Guardrails that sanitize inputs, restrict tool-calling permissions, and validate outputs are becoming essential.</li>



<li><strong>Copyright and content ownership. </strong>Many foundation models are trained on data scraped from the public internet, creating disputes over copyright and data provenance. Enterprises using generated output commercially need to confirm usage rights and review indemnity terms from vendors.</li>



<li><strong>Unrealistic productivity expectations. </strong>Finally, organizations sometimes expect generative AI to deliver instant productivity gains. The reality, it turns out, is more mixed. Enterprise adoption requires infrastructure, governance, retraining, and cultural change. The models accelerate work once properly integrated, but they don’t automatically replace human judgment or oversight.</li>
</ul>



<p>The current generation of enterprise AI systems includes several layers of defense against these risks:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Guardrails</em> that constrain model behavior and filter unsafe outputs.</li>



<li><em>Model validation</em> frameworks that measure factual accuracy and consistency before deployment.</li>



<li><em>Policy layers</em> that enforce compliance rules, redact sensitive data, and log model actions.</li>
</ul>



<p>These safeguards reduce—but don’t remove—the inherent uncertainty that defines generative AI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GenAI: essential for the enterprise</strong></h3>



<p>Generative AI has evolved from a novelty into a core layer of enterprise technology. Foundation models and agentic systems now power automation, analytics, and creative workflows — but they remain fundamentally probabilistic tools. Their strength lies in scale and adaptability, not perfect understanding.</p>



<p>For organizations, success depends less on chasing model breakthroughs than on integrating these systems responsibly: building guardrails, maintaining oversight, and aligning them with real business needs. Used wisely, generative AI can amplify human capability rather than replace it.</p>
