<p>It usually starts with an uncomfortable question. In my case, it was asked in a meeting room with lukewarm coffee and one too many opinions:</p>



<p><em>“We are not a tech company. Why should our tech roster be so heavy? Can’t we just outsource the team and focus on our core business?”</em></p>



<p>The question wasn’t new. It’s probably asked in some form or another in every organization that’s serious about technology, but still trying to figure out what serious really means. You can hear a pin drop in the room during these moments, not because no one has answers, but because everyone has different ones.</p>



<p>That silence is often where real transformation begins.</p>



<p>This piece began as a three-part experiment on LinkedIn. A few private conversations later, I realized it deserved a larger stage. I decided to rebuild it from the ground up, incorporating the insights from these conversations.</p>



<p>In physics, the “Three-body problem” is a classical idea with messy consequences: Three celestial bodies in orbit, locked in a push-and-pull dance so complex that even math throws its hands up.</p>



<p>It’s a perfect metaphor for digital transformation.</p>



<p>The three bodies in transformation are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The organization</strong> <strong>in its transformational journey</strong> — pulling for control and efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>The transformation partners</strong> — the force that can accelerate or destabilise the efforts.</li>



<li><strong>The talent</strong> — orbiting with its own velocity, shaped by ambition, life stage and opportunity.</li>
</ul>



<p><br>Nobody’s in charge, but everyone’s pulling and pushing…and that’s why most digital transformations wobble before they learn to harmonise.</p>



<p>Transformation doesn’t travel in a straight line; it dances in orbit, tugged by shifting forces. This first article in a three-part series focuses on Body 1 — the transforming organization. The body that sets the orbit and holds the rhythm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="act-i-when-everything-looks-perfect-on-paper">Act I: When everything looks perfect on paper</h3>



<p>Every transformation begins with a fancy deck — a palatable storyline, promising timelines and perfectly achievable milestones. It looks like a symphony waiting to happen. Then reality walks in — messy, human and in no mood to follow your Gantt chart.</p>



<p>Inside the organization, culture begins raising its weary head. Decision-making slows down because everyone’s waiting to see which way the wind will blow. This is the most fragile stage – and the one where organizations are most tempted to lean too heavily on external partners, hoping speed — or someone else — will deliver the clarity that’s still missing within.</p>



<p>But belief can’t be outsourced. At this point, transformation needs in-house teams who become a part of the family and are vested enough to understand the culture, history, tensions and undercurrents that shape the work. Without that anchor, the most sophisticated plan can feel strangely hollow.</p>



<p>Many organizations throw large partner teams into the mix too early — and then spend the next year explaining what their business actually does. Early transformation is about building conviction inside the house before opening the door to guests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-first-fork-in-the-road">The first fork in the road.</h3>



<p>Every transforming organization hits a crucial fork early on:</p>



<p>Do you digitize the processes you already have — essentially making yesterday run faster — or do you use this moment to reimagine what tomorrow could be?</p>



<p>The first path is seductive. It offers quick wins, familiar structures and minimal discomfort. But it usually leads to a more efficient version of the past.</p>



<p>The second path is uncomfortable. It demands questioning old assumptions, redesigning processes for a market that may look very different in three to five years. It’s harder at the start, but it buys you relevance in the long run.</p>



<p>True transformation is not about memorialising what worked five years ago. It’s about building the foundation that will help you leapfrog into the next five. Most of the complexities that follow begin right here, at this first fork in the road.</p>



<p>As a recent McKinsey analysis states, digital transformation isn’t just about technology upgrades — it’s a complete rewiring of how organizations operate and create value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="act-ii-blueprints-and-impatience">Act II: Blueprints and impatience</h3>



<p>As the dust settles down, camaraderie ushers in trust, champions emerge, the transformation’s architecture takes shape and things start to gather momentum.</p>



<p>This is where the balancing act begins. Internal teams hold the strategic spine. Partners bring depth and velocity.</p>



<p>Done well, it’s a duet. Done poorly, it’s a tug-of-war.</p>



<p>Consider the common scenario: The leadership team is impatient, the ink on that strategy is barely dry, the cogs in the technology machine have barely learnt to work together but the pressure has built up to highlight results. Inevitably, external capacity is ramped up, deadlines are met, but alignment starts unravelling, quietly.</p>



<p>A few months in, the project looks busy but not alive. Teams are overwhelmed, time is ticking, costs are creeping, frustration levels get elevated, tempers start flying and leadership starts wondering why the numbers don’t match the story.</p>



<p>Too much dependency on external teams in this phase risks losing strategic clarity. Too little, and progress drags. This isn’t a contracting problem. It’s choreography, as it’s meant to be.</p>



<p>Studies on evidence-based change management have found that sustainable transformation depends less on structure and more on leadership trust, culture and organizational readiness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-quiet-bill-of-act-ii">The quiet bill of Act II</h3>



<p>Most cost debates happen in act two— scope creep, budget creep, change requests, extra hands, travel and stay overruns. But what rarely gets tallied is the cost of hesitation.</p>



<p>When organizations can’t decide how much to insource or partner, what to keep in scope, what to keep out, the transformation doesn’t wait politely. Opportunity cost piles up quietly: launches stall, markets shift, competitors advance.</p>



<p>Over-insourcing creates drag. Partnering too early creates speed without direction. Either way, indecision has a price — and it’s paid in momentum. I’ve sat in far too many discussions where months were lost not to bad strategy, but to strategic indecision. And that has made me believe that momentum is the only currency that transformations truly trade in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="act-iii-dense-fog-to-effortless-flow">Act III: Dense fog to effortless flow</h3>



<p>At some point, the programme finally finds its rhythm (if it hasn’t quietly retreated to the shadows). Users adapt. Technology stabilises. Systems mature. The unknowns become known and known problems can be standardized, tracked and solutions scaled.</p>



<p>This is the natural point to lean on partners more heavily. Internal teams set the direction. Partners carry the operational load. It’s no longer about building belief — it’s about sustaining momentum.</p>



<p>This shift only works if organizations resist the instinct to hold on to everything they have built. Legacy ownership often weighs more than legacy systems. The tricky part is the emotional weight. Letting go of what you built isn’t easy.</p>



<p>I’ve seen teams cling to what they once fought to create — not because they should, but because it feels like surrender. Letting go at the right time doesn’t weaken the centre — it fortifies it.</p>



<p>This is the phase where good leaders stop clutching and start conducting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="act-iv-rhythm-replaces-heroics">Act IV: Rhythm replaces heroics</h3>



<p>When transformations mature, they become quieter. Less theatre, more tempo. The organization keeps its strategic core. Partners provide elasticity. Talent flows through the system with less resistance. The work starts speaking for itself.</p>



<p>This stage is rarely celebrated because it’s not dramatic. But it’s the one that separates enduring systems from short-lived surges.</p>



<p>Lose that rhythm and two things usually happen:  You end up bloated with in-house teams and struggle to pivot, or you hollow out, over-rotating to different partners and losing your strategic focus.</p>



<p>Neither is a great look.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="timing-is-the-real-strategy">Timing is the real strategy</h3>



<p>The same model that accelerates you in one stage can quietly trip you up in another. What matters isn’t the model itself. It’s when and how you use it.</p>



<p>Many organizations treat team structure like a fixed asset. But transformation behaves more like weather — shifting, unpredictable and indifferent to your plans.</p>



<p>When your capacity model moves in sync with the transformation curve, the conversation shifts from cost management to strategic leverage. You’re not just saving money; you’re preserving momentum.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="leadership-the-quiet-constant">Leadership: The quiet constant</h3>



<p>No structure survives without leadership that can consciously shift postures as the transformation matures:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In the early stage, leaders build belief and culture.</li>



<li>In the middle, they balance urgency with structure.</li>



<li>In the later stages, they let go with clarity and trust.</li>
</ul>



<p>It is less about personality and more about timing. The leaders who know when to hold, when to lean in and when to step back — they keep the orbit stable. The others usually end up in crisis meetings that could have been avoided. As Harvard Business Review noted in “Why so many high-profile digital transformations fail,” many digital transformations fail not because of flawed technology or lack of talent, but because leaders underestimate the role of timing and alignment in sustaining change.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="reflection-in-the-rear-view-mirror">Reflection in the rear-view mirror</h3>



<p>Transformations derail not because the partner or the technology failed, but because timing did. The wrong model at the wrong moment acts like gravity in reverse. It doesn’t just slow you down — it pulls everything off orbit.</p>



<p>Get the timing right, and the system starts to move with you. That’s when transformation stops being a crusade and becomes muscle memory.</p>
