<p>Data analytics is the lifeblood of any successful business. Getting the technology right can be challenging, but building the right team with the right skills to undertake data initiatives can be even harder.</p>



<p>Successfully deploying big data initiatives requires more than data scientists and data analysts. It requires data architects, who design the blueprint for your enterprise data management framework, as well as data engineers, who can build that framework and the data pipelines to bring in, process, and create business value out of data.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-architect-roles-and-responsibilities">Data architect roles and responsibilities</h3>



<p>Data architects are senior visionaries who translate business requirements into technology requirements, and define data standards and principles. They typically have years of experience in data design, data management, and data storage.</p>



<p>Typical data architect responsibilities include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Translating business requirements into technical specifications, including data streams, integrations, transformations, databases, and data warehouses</li>



<li>Defining the data architecture framework, standards, and principles, including modeling, metadata, security, reference data such as product codes and client categories, and master data such as clients, vendors, materials, and employees</li>



<li>Defining reference architecture, which is a pattern others can follow to create and improve data systems</li>



<li>Defining data flows, i.e., which parts of the organization generate data, which require data to function, how data flows are managed, and how data changes in transition</li>



<li>Collaborating and coordinating with multiple departments, stakeholders, partners, and external vendors</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-engineer-roles-and-responsibilities">Data engineer roles and responsibilities</h3>



<p>Data engineers are responsible for managing and organizing data, while also keeping an eye out for trends or inconsistencies that will impact business goals. Data engineers also design, build, and optimize systems for data collection, storage, access, and analytics at scale. They create data pipelines used by data scientists, data-centric applications, and other data consumers. Data engineers are typically skilled in technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and other tools from the open-source big data ecosystem, and at programming in Java, Scala, or Python.</p>



<p>Typical data engineer responsibilities include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing, constructing, testing, and maintaining architectures</li>



<li>Data acquisition</li>



<li>Developing data set processes</li>



<li>Identifying ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality</li>



<li>Deploying sophisticated analytics programs, machine learning, and statistical methods</li>



<li>Preparing data for predictive and prescriptive modeling</li>



<li>Using data to discover tasks that can be automated</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="benefits-of-certification">Benefits of certification</h3>



<p>If you’re looking to get an edge for either of these essential data roles, certification is a great option. Certifications measure your knowledge and skills against industry- and vendor-specific benchmarks to prove to employers you have the right skillset for the job.</p>



<p>Below is our guide to the most sought-after data engineer and data architect certifications to help you decide which is right for you. Not finding what you’re looking for? Check out our list of data analytics certifications.</p>
