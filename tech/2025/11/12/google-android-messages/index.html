<p>No matter what type of Android phone you carry or how you usually use it, one thing is a near-universal constant:</p>



<p>You’re gonna spend a ton of time messing with messages.</p>



<p>The messages may be from clients, colleagues, or your cousin Crissy from Cleveland (damn it, Crissy!). But regardless of who sends ’em or what they’re about, they’re all poppin’ up on your phone and cluttering your weary brainspace.</p>



<p>My fellow Android adorer, I’m here to tell you there’s a better way.</p>



<p>Google’s Android Messages app has gotten surprisingly good over the years. That’s no big secret. If you only rely on what you see on the surface, though, you’re missing out on some of Messages’ most powerful and underappreciated efficiency-enhancing options.</p>



<p><strong>[Hey: Want even more advanced Android knowledge? </strong><a href="https://www.theintelligence.com/shortcut-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Check out my free Android Shortcut Supercourse</strong></a><strong> to learn tons of time-saving tricks —</strong> <strong>for messaging and beyond!]</strong></p>



<p>Today, we’ll explore the Android Messages app’s most effective out-of-sight superpowers. They may not be able to cut down on the <em>number </em>of messages you send and receive on your phone (DAMN IT, CRISSY!), but they <em>will</em> help you spend less time fussing with ’em. And they might just help you have a more pleasant experience, too.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in, shall we?</p>



<p>(Before you splash forward, take note: The tips on this page are all specific to the Google Messages app for Android. If you’re using a phone where that exact app wasn’t preinstalled or set as the default, you can download it from the Play Store and give it a whirl. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-1-custom-icons">Android Messages trick #1: Custom icons</h3>



<p>We’ll start with what might be my favorite little-known trick within Google’s Android Messages app: With a couple quick adjustments, you can turn any of your contacts’ faces into a custom notification icon. That icon will then show up at the top of your phone whenever that person messages you for extra-easy visibility and access.</p>



<p>See?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>The only catch is that your phone needs to be running 2020’s Android 11 operating system or higher for the feature to be available. (And honestly, if your phone isn’t running Android 11 at this point, you’ve got bigger fish to fry, Francesco.) Also, Samsung has screwed around with this system for no apparent reason — a frustratingly common theme with Samsung’s heavily modified approach to Android, especially as of late — so you may or may not be able to take advantage of this on a Galaxy gadget, depending on how recently its software has been <s>screwed up</s> updated. (Exaggerated sigh. What more can I say?!)</p>



<p>On any reasonably recent Android device that sticks close to Google’s core Android interface, though, here’s how to make the magic happen:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The next time you get a message from someone, press and hold your finger to the notification.</li>



<li>That’ll pull up a screen that looks a little somethin’ like this:</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tap the “Priority” line, then tap “Apply” to save the changes.</li>
</ul>



<p>And that’s it: The next time that person messages you, you’ll see their profile picture in place of the standard Messages icon in your status bar, and the notification will show up in a special section above any other alerts.</p>



<p>Hip, hip, hoorah!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-2-custom-sounds">Android Messages trick #2: Custom sounds</h3>



<p>In addition to making it easier to spot an important contact by their notification icon, you can also create a custom alert sound for messages coming in from different people — or even from specific <em>threads</em> within the Google Messages app — so you immediately know what they are, even before you have a chance to look.</p>



<p>This is one of those things that’s super-basic but also awkwardly out of sight and consequently unknown to an awful lot of Android-owning organisms. But once you know where to find it, it really couldn’t be much easier to get going. And it’s all connected to Android’s notification channels, which let you get incredibly nuanced on how different types of notifications <em>within </em>apps behave.</p>



<p>The quickest way to zip where you need to be is to open the thread you want to customize within Messages itself — whether it’s a one-on-one text with an individual person or a group conversation with multiple contacts. Once you’re inside the thread, tap the three-dot menu icon in its upper-right corner and select “Details,” then select “Notifications” on the screen that comes up next.</p>



<p>And hey, wouldya look at that? You should now be staring at a series of options about how <em>that</em> exact notification behaves — including, at least in the standard Google version of Android, the all-important “Sound” setting.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, Foundry</p></div>



<p>Tap that, then find and select any sound you like. The next time a new message comes in for this conversation, there’ll be no mistaking what awaits you from the second it arrives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-3-contact-prioritizing">Android Messages trick #3: Contact prioritizing</h3>



<p>While we’re thinking about making certain conversations stand out, ever wish you could keep your most important messaging threads at the top of the list for easy ongoing access?</p>



<p>Poof: Wish granted. No matter what kind of Android phone you’re holding or how needlessly meddled with its software may be, just hold your finger onto the conversation in question on the main Messages app screen, then tap the pushpin-shaped icon in the app’s upper bar.</p>



<p>You can now pin up to <em>20 </em>conversations that way, as of just the other week, and they’ll always appear above all other threads in that main inbox view.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-4-short-term-tune-out">Android Messages trick #4: Short-term tune-out</h3>



<p>Some incoming messages always require your immediate attention. Others, in contrast, are best tuned out and caught up with much later.</p>



<p>Surely you’ve been in that type of thread before, right? Y’know, the one where people are getting just a little <em>too</em> active — sending message after message, typically either during your workday or while you’re trying to focus on anything other than their uninteresting missives?</p>



<p>Google’s Android Messages app actually has a great way to deal with such struggles. It’s a temporary snoozing mechanism that lets you opt out of notifications from one specific conversation and that conversation <em>only</em> and stop receiving alerts from it for a set amount of time.</p>



<p>To try it out, press and hold your finger onto any thread in your main Messages list, then look for the clock icon with a “z” inside of it at the top of the screen. Tap that, and you can then decide to snooze notifications from that single conversation for one hour, eight hours, 24 hours, or — if you <em>really</em> want to tune it out — forever.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, Foundry</p></div>



<p>You’ll continue to get notifications from all other conversations in the meantime, and you’ll still be able to see new activity from the snoozed thread by opening up Messages and actively looking at it. But you won’t be interrupted by its alerts again — for a little while, at least.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-5-gemini-be-gone">Android Messages trick #5: Gemini be gone</h3>



<p>Speaking of tuning out distractions, if you rarely to never interact with Google’s Gemini chatbot from inside the Messages app — perhaps because, y’know, it’s also available in approximately 7 gazillion other in-your-face places — you might appreciate the distraction-free satisfaction of an interface <em>without</em> a prominent Gemini button begging for you to caress it every frickin’ time you open up your messages.</p>



<p>(The Gemin icon is that starbust-shaped symbol that sits perpetually above the “Start chat” button, in Messages’ lower-right corner, if you haven’t ever tapped it to find out.)</p>



<p>And good news: You <em>can</em> actually send that icon a-packin’, if you’re so inspired: Just tap your profile picture in Messages’ upper-right corner, select “Messages settings,” then tap “Gemini in Messages” and flip the switch on the screen that comes up next into the off and inactive position.</p>



<p>All that’s left is to pat yourself on the back and celebrate the fact that you’ll only have to see Gemini in 6.9 gazillion <em>other </em>places from this point forward.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-6-free-in-flight-wi-fi">Android Messages trick #6: Free in-flight Wi-Fi</h3>



<p>Gemini may be little more than a distraction within Messages <em>most</em> of the time, but one moment when that capability can actually come in handy is while you’re flying the allegedly friendly skies.</p>



<p>A while back, a crafty reader alerted me to the fact that you could use Gemini’s Messages integration to effectively give yourself free in-flight Wi-Fi access even when you haven’t paid for the privilege. It’s a heck of a clever hack and a moment when you genuinely may want to activate Gemini within the Messages app, at least for a little while.</p>



<p>I’ve got a complete breakdown of <a href="https://theintelligence.com/39136/free-in-flight-wifi-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how it works and how <em>you</em> can put it to use on <em>your</em> next flight</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-7-calendar-connection">Android Messages trick #7: Calendar connection</h3>



<p>Whether from the sky or on the regular ol’ ground, the next time you’re working to plan a meeting or event with a fellow Homo sapien in Messages, make yourself a mental note of this:</p>



<p>Anytime someone sends you a message that includes a specific date and time, the Messages app will underline that text. See it?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>You’d be forgiven for failing to realize, but you can actually <em>tap </em>that underlined text to reveal a shortcut for opening that very same day and time in your Android calendar app of choice. It’s a great way to get a quick ‘n’ easy glimpse at your availability for the time you’re discussing.</p>



<p>And if you then want to create a calendar event, just look for the “Create event” command that should appear right below that very same message. That’ll fire up a new calendar event for you on the spot, with the appropriate day and time already filled in.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Don’tcha just love simple step-savers?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-8-seamless-scheduling">Android Messages trick #8: Seamless scheduling</h3>



<p>If you’re ready to hammer out a response to a message right now but don’t want your reply to be sent for a while, follow the advice shared by a reader in my Android Intelligence newsletter recently and simply schedule your message for some specific future time.</p>



<p>The Android Messages app’s scheduling system is spectacularly useful. You can rely on it for setting reminders to be sent to clients, business-related messages to be pushed out the next morning, or context-free middle-finger emojis to be delivered to your cousin in Cleveland at ungodly hours in the middle of the night.</p>



<p>To tap into this productivity-boosting power, just type out your message normally — but then, instead of <em>tapping </em>the triangle-shaped send icon at the right of the composing window, press and <em>hold </em>your finger onto that same button when you’re done.</p>



<p>No reasonably sane person would possibly realize it, but that’ll pull up a hidden menu for selecting precisely when your message should be sent.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>And the person on the other end will have no way of even knowing you wrote the thing in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-9-swift-saving">Android Messages trick #9: Swift saving</h3>



<p>When you run into a message you know you’ll want to reference again, save yourself the trouble of trying to dig it back up later and instead star it on the spot to make it fast as can be to find in the future.</p>



<p>It couldn’t be much easier to do: Whilst viewing an individual message thread, just press and hold your finger onto the specific message you want to save, then tap the star-shaped icon that appears in the bar at the top of the screen.</p>



<p>Then, when you want to find the message again, tap the search icon at the top of the main Messages screen and select “Starred” from the menu that comes up. That’ll show you every message you’ve starred for exceptionally effortless resurfacing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-10-smart-searching">Android Messages trick #10: Smart searching</h3>



<p>Speaking of that Messages search system: Starring is sublime, but sometimes, you need to dig up an old message that you <em>didn’t</em> go out of your way to save.</p>



<p>The Android Messages app makes that even easier than you might realize. Tap that same search icon at the top of the app’s main screen — and in addition to searching your entire history message for any specific string of text, take note:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You can start typing out the name of anyone in your contacts, then select them from the suggestion that appears — and then type in some text to look for something specific only within messages from <em>that </em>one person.</li>



<li>You can use the options within the main Messages search screen to look specifically at images, videos, locations, or links people have sent you.</li>



<li>And you can combine any of those variables for even more granular finding — looking for links you sent to a particular client, for instance, or locations an out-of-town colleague sent to you.</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>How ’bout <em>them</em> apples?!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-11-instant-marking">Android Messages trick #11: Instant marking</h3>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I find it impossibly irksome to see messages sitting with bold emphasis in my Android Messages inbox. That, to me, is a marking that means I need to read (and possibly also respond) to the message in question. And I can’t possibly rest for the day until I know that everything in my Messages inbox is open, addressed, and dealt with (or at least opened and with a reminder set to deal with it at some specific future time).</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, it’s all too easy to fall behind and get a backlog of bolded messages — and in such scenarios, sometimes, you need a quick ‘n’ easy one-switch reset button to bring everything back to read status and give yourself a fresh start.</p>



<p>Well, surprise: Messages has such an option! Tap your profile picture in the app’s upper-right corner and look for “Mark all as read” in the menu that comes up to find it — then breathe a sigh of relief as all that attention-demanding boldness melts away once and for all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-12-easier-to-read-text">Android Messages trick #12: Easier-to-read text</h3>



<p>On the subject of more noticeable text, file this next Android Messages feature under “accidental discoveries”: The next time you find yourself squinting at something in a messaging thread on your phone, try a good old-fashioned zoom gesture on the screen — placing your finger and thumb together and then spreading ’em slowly apart.</p>



<p>You’d never know it, but the Messages app supports that standard gesture for zooming into a conversation. The inverse applies, too: When you’re ready to zoom back out and make everything smaller, just bring your two fingers closer together.</p>



<p>And if those actions <em>aren’t</em> working for you, tap your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the main Messages screen and select “Messages settings,” then make sure the toggle next to “Pinch to zoom conversation text” is in the on position.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-13-custom-colors">Android Messages trick #13: Custom colors</h3>



<p>While we’re thinkin’ about easier reading, a relatively recent Android Messages addition can let you create a custom color palette for any conversations you’ve got goin’.</p>



<p>That way, you can always remember that texts with your significant other are in, say, purple, whereas messages with your most important client are in red. (Best not to get those two threads confused.)</p>



<p>This one works only with messages sent using the modern RCS messaging platform, which basically means messages that don’t involve pesky people still carrying around iPhones with outdated software on ’em. (It’s always the iPhone people, isn’t it?!)</p>



<p>With any currently supported conversation, open up the thread within Messages — then:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tap the three-dot menu icon in the screen’s upper-right corner.</li>



<li>Select “Change colors” from the menu that appears.</li>



<li>Pick the color scheme you prefer, then tap the Confirm button at the bottom.</li>
</ul>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Repeat for any other compatible conversations, and you’ll always know exactly what you’re looking at even with a fast glance — and without having to give it an ounce of active thought.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-14-meatier-media">Android Messages trick #14: Meatier media</h3>



<p>You know a fantastic way to waste time? I’ll tell ya: moving from one app to another just to glance at something someone sent you (like those blasted Bangles video Crissy is always blasting your way).</p>



<p>But get this: Google’s Android Messages app can let you preview and get the gist of both text articles and even YouTube videos without ever leaving your current conversation — from right within the app and that very same message thread.</p>



<p>The key is to make sure you’ve got the associated options enabled:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tap your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the main Messages screen.</li>



<li>Select “Messages settings,” then tap “Automatic previews.”</li>



<li>Make sure the toggle next to “Show all previews” is on and active.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, the next time someone sends you a link, you’ll see the associated item’s thumbnail and description right then and there, within the Messages conversation:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>With web pages, Messages will show you just enough of a preview to let you make an educated decision about whether you want to tap the link or not.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Almost painfully sensible, no?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-15-smarter-shortcuts">Android Messages trick #15: Smarter shortcuts</h3>



<p>If I had to pick the simplest Android Messages trick for enhancing your efficiency, it’d be embracing the built-in shortcuts Google gives us for faster message actions.</p>



<p>From the main Messages screen, you can swipe left or right on any message to perform an instant action — archiving the conversation, permanently deleting it, or toggling it between read and unread status.</p>



<p>All you’ve gotta do is mosey your way back into the Messages app’s settings areas and tap on the “Swipe actions” item to set things up the way you want…</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>…and then, just remember to actually <em>use </em>those gestures moving forward. (That part’s on you.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-16-quicker-cleanup">Android Messages trick #16: Quicker cleanup</h3>



<p>Certain services love to send confirmation codes via text messaging when you sign in or try to perform some action. It may not be the most advisable or effective form of extra security, but — well, it’s better than nothing. And for better or for worse, it’s a pretty common tactic.</p>



<p>Core security considerations aside, the most irksome part of these confirmation codes is having ’em clutter up your messages list at every Goog-forsaken moment. But the Google-made Android Messages app can actually take care of that for you, without any ongoing effort — if you take about 20 seconds to make the right tweak now.</p>



<p>Here’s the secret: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tappity-tap that comely character in the upper-right corner of the main Messages screen (y’know, the one whose appearance has a striking resemblance to your oversized head).</li>



<li>Tap “Messages settings” in the menu that comes up, then select “Messages organization.”</li>



<li>Within that curiously created section, you’ll see only one option: “Auto-delete OTPs after 24 hrs.” OTP may not exactly be an everyday, universally known abbreviation, but fear not — for it <em>isn’t</em> an erroneous reference to an early 90s rap hit with equally ambiguous meaning. Nope: It stands for one-time password, which is the same thing we’re thinking about here.</li>



<li>Flip that toggle into the on and active position, then flip a finger of your choice to all the confirmation codes in your messages list and rest easy knowing they’ll be auto-purged a day after their arrival from that point forward.</li>
</ul>



<p>Who’s down with OTP? Every last homie. (I apologize.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-17-readable-reactions">Android Messages trick #17: Readable reactions</h3>



<p>Slack-style reactions may seem silly on the surface, but they serve an important communication purpose in allowing you to quickly acknowledge a message without having to carry the conversation on further. Whether it’s a thumbs-up, a clapping hands symbol, or even perhaps an occasional burrito emoji, it really can be a handy way to say “Yup, got it” (or “Yup, want beefy goodness”) without having to use a single word.</p>



<p>You probably know you can summon a reaction within the Android Messages app by pressing and holding a specific message within a conversation and then selecting from the list of available emoji options — right? But beyond that, Messages packs an even faster way to issue a reaction in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>And here it is: Simply <em>double-tap</em> your finger onto any individual message within a conversation. That’ll apply the thumbs-up reaction to it without the need for any long-press or symbol selection.</p>



<p>It’d be nice if there were a way to customize which reaction is used for that action by default — so that, obviously, we could all change it to the burrito emoji, since that’s what any sane person uses most often — but if and when an upward thumb will do the job, now you’ve got a super-easy way to bring it into any conversation with a fast finger tap.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="android-messages-trick-18-irritation-elimination">Android Messages trick #18: iRritation elimination</h3>



<p>Last but not least in our list of magnificent Messages enhancements is something specific for your conversations with the Apple-adoring animals in your life. And it relates to those very same sorts of reactions we were just going over.</p>



<p>One obnoxious side effect of Apple’s “no one exists outside of iOS” mentality, y’see, is the way the iPhone’s equivalent of those reactions show up on Android. Plain and simple, they show up as — well, plain and simple text messages, instead of coming through as reactions.</p>



<p>Surely you’ve encountered this, right? Those pointless messages you get from iGoobers that say stuff like “Loved ‘Please stop texting me, Crissy'”?</p>



<p>Well, scribble this on your metaphorical mental iPad: Google’s Android Messages app is actually able to intercept those absurd platform-specific reactions and turn ’em into <em>standard </em>reactions instead of plain-text interruptions. And it’ll take you all of 12 seconds to enable the option:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Head back into the Messages app’s settings.</li>



<li>Tap “Advanced.”</li>



<li>Look for the line labeled “Show iPhone reactions as emoji” and make sure the toggle next to it is in the on position.</li>
</ul>



<p>All that’s left is to breathe one final heavy sigh of relief — and to send Crissy a well-deserved burrito reaction.</p>
