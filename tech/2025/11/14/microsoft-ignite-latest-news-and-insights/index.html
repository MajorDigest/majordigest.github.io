<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Previous Microsoft Ignite coverage</strong></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Microsoft to launch autonomous AI at Ignite</strong></h3>



<p><em>Oct. 21, 2024</em>: Microsoft will let customers build autonomous AI agents that can be configured to perform complex tasks with little or no input from humans. Microsoft announced that tools to build AI agents in Copilot Studio will be available in a public beta that begins at Ignite on Nov. 19, with pre-built agents rolling out to Dynamics 365 apps in the coming months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Microsoft Ignite 2023: 11 takeaways for CIOs</strong></h3>



<p><em>Nov. 15, 2023</em>: Microsoft’s 2023 Ignite conference might as well be called AIgnite, with over half of the almost 600 sessions featuring AI in some shape or form. Generative AI (genAI), in particular, is at the heart of many of the product announcements Microsoft is making at the event, including new AI capabilities for wrangling large language models (LLMs) in Azure, new additions to the Copilot range of genAI assistants, new hardware, and a new tool to help developers deploy small language models (SLMs) too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Microsoft partners with Nvidia, Synopsys for genAI services</strong></h3>



<p><em>Nov. 16, 2023</em>: Microsoft has announced that it is partnering with chipmaker Nvidia and chip-designing software provider Synopsys to provide enterprises with foundry services and a new chip-design assistant. The foundry services from Nvidia will be deployed on Microsoft Azure and will combine three of Nvidia’s elements — its foundation models, its NeMo framework, and Nvidia’s DGX Cloud service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="as-microsoft-embraces-ai-it-says-sayonara-to-the-metaverse">As Microsoft embraces AI, it says sayonara to the metaverse</h3>



<p><em>Feb. 23, 2023:</em> It wasn’t just Mark Zuckerberg who led the metaverse charge by changing Facebook’s name to Meta. Microsoft hyped it as well, notably when CEO Satya Nadella said, “I can’t overstate how much of a breakthrough this is,” in his keynote speech at Microsoft Ignite in 2021. Now, tech companies are much wiser, they tell us. It’s AI at heart of the coming transformation. The metaverse may be yesterday’s news, but it’s not yet dead.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Microsoft Ignite in the rear-view mirror: What we learned</strong></h3>



<p><em>Oct. 17, 2022</em>: Microsoft treated its big Ignite event as more of a marketing presentation than a full-fledged conference, offering up a variety of announcements that affect Windows users, as well as large enterprises and their networks. (The show was a hybrid affair, with a small in-person option and online access for those unable to travel.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Related  Microsoft coverage</strong></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Microsoft’s AI research VP joins OpenAI amid fight for top AI talent</strong></h3>



<p><em>Oct. 15, 2024</em>: Microsoft’s former vice president of genAI research, Sebastien Bubeck, left the company to join OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Microsoft wants Copilot to be your new AI best friend</strong></h3>



<p><em>Oct. 9, 2024:</em> Microsoft’s Copilot AI chatbot underwent a transformation last week, morphing into a simplified pastel-toned experience that encourages you…to just chat. “Hey Chris, how’s the human world today?” That’s what I heard after I fired up the Copilot app on Windows 11 and clicked the microphone button, complete with a calming wavey background. Yes, this is the type of banter you get with the new Copilot.</p>
