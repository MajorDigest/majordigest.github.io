<p>In his new book,  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Sun-Climate-Civilization/dp/B0F95QL1C2/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=189574573187&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dUL0I-2QrlfekUZqM1ryCwH4sZBSS26Bb8rGcgmKaXs.ki3iOFbyKUiizDTa5Vuwu4O-IMe5kjypPJnPhGkAWIA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=779535116079&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvexpln=0&amp;hvlocphy=9002004&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvocijid=1141085844004484903--&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1141085844004484903&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2454666306714&amp;hydadcr=22593_13730688_8237&amp;keywords=here+comes+the+sun+bill+mckibben&amp;mcid=fb73b62c80563ecfa1a56debeb75e688&amp;qid=1763005144&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Here Comes The Sun</em></a>, author and activist Bill McKibben argues that we’re at a tipping point where solar and wind power is now cheaper to build and harness than fossil fuels. Because of that new economic reality, he argues renewable energy has the power to transform society—if only the U.S. government would listen.</p>



<p>McKibben, who also publishes a free Substack called<strong> </strong><a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/"><em>The Crucial Years</em></a>, came on the<em> Most Innovative Companies</em> podcast to talk about what Bill Gates is getting wrong about climate concerns, how solar became cheaper than fossil fuels, and the importance of mobilizing senior citizens in the fight against climate change through his organization Third Act.<br><br><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. </em></p>



<p><strong><strong>In a </strong><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate"><strong>recent blog post,</strong></a><strong> Bill Gates downgraded climate concerns as an issue of importance. What do you think of his argument?</strong></strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had a checkered relationship with Mr. Gates and [his views on] climate for some years. I reviewed his last book for the <em>New York Times</em>. He didn&#8217;t like my review, so he complained vociferously in <em>Rolling Stone</em> the next day in a long interview. The first thing to understand about Bill Gates is it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s been all over this from the start. It took him until 2006, which was 18 years after Jim Hanson told us that the planet was heating up, to conclude that it was actually a real problem and not something that nature was going to solve by itself. Now he&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s don&#8217;t worry too much about it because we should be working on other things instead.&#8221;</p>



<p>The best interpreter of his letter was of course the President of the United States who quite succinctly on Truth Social announced that Bill Gates says climate change is a hoax. It&#8217;s not quite what he said, but for all intents and purposes he might as well have. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s because Mr. Gates&#8217;s empire at the moment depends—like all the other billionaires—on sucking up to this guy.</p>



<p>Gates released his document the same day that Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica with the highest wind speeds we&#8217;ve ever recorded, the kind of wind speed you can only get when you&#8217;ve dramatically increased the heat content of the ocean by warming the atmosphere. We don&#8217;t have a final number yet. We won&#8217;t for a long time. There&#8217;s parts of it people still haven&#8217;t really reached yet, but the insurance industry was estimating that it wiped out between 30% and 250% of Jamaica&#8217;s annual GDP. So let&#8217;s transpose that to the United States. That would be as if Hurricane Katrina, which did a $100 billion worth damage here, had done $9 trillion worth of damage here.</p>



<p>All in all, it&#8217;s just a way of saying that Gates is being silly here, especially because the most important tool that we have for rapid development in the developing world—the quick rapid adoption of solar energy—is also the thing that would be most useful for dealing with the climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Despite all those upsetting facts you just shared, in the intro to the book, you say that after decades of pessimism, you now see at least some room for optimism in the climate conversation. Why is that?</strong></p>



<p>About five years ago, we crossed some invisible line where it became cheaper to produce energy from the sun and wind and batteries than from burning coal and gas and oil. I&#8217;ll note that that was the same year that Bill Gates published his last book explaining why there was a huge green premium because it was so expensive to [get energy from] sun and wind. He managed to miss what was happening.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a really epochal moment for human civilization. Human beings have been setting things on fire for 700,000 years. Darwin said that language and fire were the two things that set our species apart. Now we don&#8217;t need the fire anymore. Fossil fuel combustion kills nine million people a year directly on this planet. About one in five deaths come from just from breathing in particles that lodge in your lungs. There are five million schoolchildren in New Delhi. Two and a half million of them have irreversible lung damage from breathing the air. And as long as we depend on fossil fuel, we&#8217;re in the pocket of the people who control the small deposits of these resources around the world. The king of Saudi Arabia—great guy—Vladimir Putin, who has taken his winnings and launched a land war in Europe in the 21st century, and the CEO of Exxon. The last 36 months have seen a huge surge in clean energy. We&#8217;re getting a third more power from the sun this autumn than we were last autumn on this planet. We&#8217;ve hit that steep part of the S curve and we&#8217;ve got to keep it going.</p>



<p><strong>When you were working on this book, did you also consider nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuel?</strong></p>



<p>Nuclear power, I&#8217;ve got no real problem with. Everybody knows what the dangers are, but those dangers are considerably smaller than the dangers of overheating the planet. Maybe someday someone will make nuclear power at a price that allows us to do it with some speed and at some scale, but so far we&#8217;re not there. </p>



<p>And it&#8217;s hard because nuclear power has to compete with the very inexpensive power that you can get from the sun and the wind and the speed with which you can build those things. If you want to build yourself a data center and you need a power supply, [using] nuclear power is going to take you some years to build it.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Chinese were building three gigawatts of solar panels a day in May. A gigawatt is the rough equivalent of a coal-fired power plant. So they were putting up one of those every eight hours. This stuff snaps together, it&#8217;s not hard.</p>



<p><strong>If China is moving so quickly on solar, why is installing solar panels in the U.S. so expensive?</strong></p>



<p>In most of the world, if you want solar panels on your roof, you call somebody on Monday and they&#8217;re there by Friday. Here, it&#8217;s a monthslong odyssey. We&#8217;ve got 15,000 municipalities. Each has their own building code. All of this is unnecessary.</p>



<p>The National Renewable Energy Lab gave us this nifty little tool called the SolarAPP. A contractor can tap in the address where they&#8217;re putting up the solar panel and the equipment, and if the computer likes the match, it gives them an instant permit and they get to work on the roof. California, Maryland, and New Jersey have adopted this. When that kind of stuff really takes off, the results are amazing.</p>



<p>In Australia, 40% of homes have&nbsp; solar panels on their roof. The government in Australia announced that beginning next year they will have so much solar power in the afternoon that electricity will be free for all Australians for three hours every afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>You said we’ve crossed this invisible line where solar became the cheapest form of energy on earth. How does this shift the economic argument for governments?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In the rest of the world? Absolutely. This work&#8217;s being pioneered in China. They&#8217;re the ones who are doing two-thirds of the clean energy installation around the world, and as a result, they&#8217;re now owning things like the world&#8217;s auto industry. This is especially good for the 80% of human beings who live in countries that have to import fossil fuel. When poor countries go into payments crises or have to have the IMF come in and structurally adjust their economies, it&#8217;s almost always because at least in part, they&#8217;ve had to pay huge amounts of foreign reserves in order to get the next tanker load full of oil to keep their economy sputtering along. Now they can go spend their money on Chinese solar panels, and after that point they&#8217;re not dependent on China anymore. They&#8217;re now dependent on the sun.</p>



<p><strong>Generative AI takes an enormous amount of energy to power. How do you think about that in the context of this book?</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s stipulate for the moment that we don&#8217;t really know at the moment how much of that AI hype is a bubble and how much is real. But if you decided that you absolutely had to build lots of data centers very fast in order to stay ahead of China in this race, the easiest way to build them fast would be to use solar and wind. This is precisely what&#8217;s not happening right now. </p>



<p>At the moment, the Trump administration is all in on building data centers and all out on building cheap energy from the sun and the wind. The result is you&#8217;ve increased demand, constricted supply, and the price is going up. Americans are paying 10% more now for electricity than they did last year, and that&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>



<p><strong>You founded nonprofit Third Act to organize people over 60 to fight climate change. Why is this demographic key to changing the conversation around climate activism?</strong></p>



<p>If you look around for who has structural power, it&#8217;s really a lot of people with hairlines like mine. There are 70 million Americans over the age of 60. We punch above our weight politically because we all vote. We have lots of connections, lots of skills, and lots of time. And so it was an obvious thing to try.</p>



<p>Many people said, &#8220;This will never work because people become more conservative as they age.&#8221; I think this is not so true for this generation of old people. These are the people who were around when we started taking women seriously in public life, they saw the apex of the Civil Rights Movement. They were there for the first Earth Day in 1970 when 20 million Americans—10% of the population—marched in the biggest demonstration in American history. These are people who know that change is possible. We have it in our muscle memory. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got about a hundred thousand people around the country [that are part of Third Act], and great working groups in almost every state. They do incredible work of all kinds . . . lots of very mundane lobbying, letter writing. All of that is effective because politicians know that these people are going to be at the ballot box. As our democracy begins to flicker and falter, I think it&#8217;s particularly useful to have older people engaged in this work, because the one thing that young people can&#8217;t understand about Trump is how completely abnormal he is. </p>



<p>If nothing else, Americans, especially of my age, owe an enormous climate debt to the rest of the planet. If you&#8217;re 70 now, you&#8217;ve been alive to watch more than 80% of all the carbon that humans have ever produced be put into the atmosphere. And that made your life conspicuously easier. Now it&#8217;s making everybody but especially poor people&#8217;s lives conspicuously harder. So we&#8217;ve got some work to do.</p>



<p><strong>You’ve said there are two forces slowing the transition to renewables down. Those are inertia and vested interest. And I&#8217;m curious how should climate activism evolve to fight those two things?</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ve talked a little bit about vested interest already. We have to win some elections. It would be a lot easier if we didn&#8217;t have things like Citizens United that allow the rich to toy with our political system. Inertia is also a big force. We do things somewhat slowly, sometimes for good economic reasons. It&#8217;s cheaper to make transitions slowly. You have to figure out ways to overcome that inertia to make it easy and exciting to do the right thing.</p>
