<p>Recently, Cisco held the Asia-Pacific version of its Cisco Live user event. While this event is typically used to announce new Cisco products, the news payload this year included an interesting customer use case.</p>



<p>The Singapore Sports Hub will soon get a major connectivity boost with a new high-density Wi-Fi 7 network. The complex in Kallang, which is home to some of Singapore’s biggest sporting and entertainment events, draws visitors from around the world. The entire venue, including its stadiums and retail spaces, will offer high-speed internet and new digital services once the rollout is complete. With this announcement, the Singapore Sports Hub becomes the first sports facility to announce Wi-Fi 7 as its Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>The venue’s owner and operator, Kallang Alive Sport Management (KASM), has tapped M1 as the lead implementer and system integrator of the new Wi-Fi 7 network, while Cisco is providing the technology behind it. At the center of this rollout is Cisco’s Wireless CW9179F, the industry’s first enterprise-grade, Wi-Fi 7-certified access points (APs) built specifically for high-density public venues.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kasm-taps-cisco-for-wi-fi-7">KASM taps Cisco for Wi-Fi 7</h3>



<p>The Cisco APs use a modular design that makes the network easier to scale and maintain. They also have built-in intelligence and automation to monitor network performance.</p>



<p>For example, one of the features is the Cisco Artificial Intelligence Radio Resource Management (AI-RRM), which analyzes radio frequency (RF) conditions and adjusts the signal strength to keep connections stable. Another feature, the Cisco AI Assistant, allows IT teams to interact with the network using conversational AI and natural language.</p>



<p>The APs can also be integrated into Cisco Spaces, a cloud-based platform for location analytics. This will provide KASM with deeper insights into crowd movement, space usage, and visitor behavior. The insights could be used to address overcrowding and staffing issues around the complex during major events.</p>



<p>The Singapore Sports Hub’s Wi-Fi 7 network will be deployed in phases across its venues. It’s expected to be completed by the first half of 2026. Cisco sees the Wi-Fi 7 rollout as part of a bigger shift toward AI-driven networks that power immersive fan experiences.</p>



<p>At its core, this initiative is a response to the rapidly evolving expectations of sports and entertainment fans. Audience demographics are shifting, with millennials and Gen Z demanding reliable, always-on connectivity and hyper-personalized digital experiences. Legacy Wi-Fi networks designed for lower-density or single-purpose events are not well-suited to handle today’s crowds, many of whom simultaneously stream video, post on social media, and access real-time event information from hundreds or even thousands of mobile devices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="immersive-participatory-and-personalized-journeys">Immersive, participatory, and personalized journeys</h3>



<p>While the press release did not call out specific use cases for the upgraded wireless network, it’s clear the new infrastructure is more than just about speed or reliability. Wi-Fi 7 at the Singapore Sports Hub unlocks a new class of immersive, participatory experiences. I expect, over time, fans should see the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) Experiences</strong>: With ultra-low latency and stable, high-bandwidth connections, AR overlays—whether for in-seat stats, live translations, or interactive games—can become a seamless part of the event. Imagine aiming a smartphone at a player or performer and receiving live stats, bios, or even virtual merchandise try-ons.</li>



<li><strong>Multi-Angle Interactive Streaming</strong>: Fans in the stadium could switch between live camera angles on their devices, access instant replays, or even get “backstage” experiences, transforming passive attendance into interactive fandom.</li>



<li><strong>Personalized Content and Offers</strong>: With robust connectivity and Cisco Spaces integration, data analytics on crowd movement and preferences can power real-time delivery of tailored offers, event information, or navigation assistance, elevating both engagement and satisfaction.​</li>



<li><strong>Frictionless Transactions</strong>: Robust Wi-Fi is the backbone for reliable mobile payments and digital ticketing, enabling everything from contactless entry to seat-side ordering that enhances convenience and reduces queuing.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="smart-operations-security-and-resilience-at-scale">Smart operations: security and resilience at scale</h3>



<p>For venue operators, the shift to Wi-Fi 7 is not just about the fan-facing benefits. The new network is infused with AI-native security, real-time radio resource management (AI-RRM), and advanced automation. This means threats can be detected and contained automatically, crowd flows can be analyzed to prevent bottlenecks or safety issues, and staff can be deployed more efficiently.​</p>



<p>Operational resilience is further improved by AgenticOps, the new Cisco model for modern IT operations driven by intelligence and automation. As events scale up in both audience numbers and technical complexity, these capabilities provide a crucial safety net.​</p>



<p>Historically, Wi-Fi adoption has tracked along the replacement cycle of older versions. I believe Wi-Fi 7 will see accelerated adoption where companies refresh early because of unique features such as Multi-Link Operations. Wi-Fi is a mission-critical service and organizations, such as Singapore Sports Hub, can use the advanced technology to roll out new customer-facing services.</p>
