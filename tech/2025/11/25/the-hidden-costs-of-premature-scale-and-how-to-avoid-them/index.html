<p>“Scale” is often mistaken for success — a signal that something works. But in practice, growth stresses not just the roadmap, but the architecture, the data layer, the incident response system and the team’s ability to operate under load. SLAs, SLOs and latency budgets that felt “good enough” at early stages begin to collapse under new concurrency and traffic patterns. I’ve seen healthy metrics mask brittle systems — until one feature launch brings everything crashing down.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Scaling too early — without aligned metrics and operational resilience — remains a top reason for product failure.</li>



<li>Metrics are only meaningful when rooted in your specific context, not borrowed benchmarks.</li>



<li>Engineering readiness (DORA, error budgets, SLOs) must evolve alongside product growth or risk failure under load.</li>
</ul>



<p>Over the past decade, I’ve watched promising teams burn out chasing vanity metrics and products buckle from premature scale. In fact, 70% of startups fail because they try to grow before the product and platform are truly ready. The real challenge isn’t how to grow faster — it’s how to grow without collapsing the system. That requires alignment across metrics, product maturity and engineering resilience.</p>



<p>One of the earliest lessons I learned: Metrics aren’t trophies — they’re mirrors. Chasing a single number, like monthly active users, once gave us impressive charts but a weak business. We were scaling vanity, not value. Today, instead of generic KPIs, I focus on 4–6 product-specific indicators — signup conversion rate, CAC, DAU-to-MAU ratio, first key action rate, retention in specific action — that reflect how value actually moves through the system. Metrics should guide awareness, not just validate success. As Goodhart’s Law reminds us: Once a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure.</p>



<p>People start gaming the number or optimizing for it at the expense of true outcomes. A notorious example was Wells Fargo’s sales scandal — management fixated on a metric (number of accounts per customer) and set such aggressive targets that employees began opening millions of fake accounts just to hit the goal. The metric looked great on paper, but it destroyed customer trust and led to billions in fines. The lesson: Don’t let <em>any single metric</em> become a false idol. Define success in a more balanced way that reflects real value creation for your product and users.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="benchmarks-as-guardrails">Benchmarks as guardrails</h3>



<p>Benchmarks are useful — but only when treated as reference points, not commandments. They help spot when something’s off (say, an unusually low conversion rate), but they’re not meant to define what success should look like for your product. Early on, I made the mistake of comparing our “chapter two” to someone else’s “chapter ten.” I’d see another SaaS boasting 50% Day-1 retention and panic that we were underperforming at 30%, without factoring in that we were solving a different problem, at a different stage, with a different user base.</p>



<p>That’s how teams end up racing in a lane that isn’t theirs. Every product exists in its own context — timing, budget, team maturity, market complexity. Benchmarks can inform, but they should never dictate. Treating them as gospel can create a dangerous illusion of objectivity — leading you to ignore your actual constraints or chase metrics that were never yours to begin with.</p>



<p>In practice, I use benchmarks the way I use weather forecasts: They tell me what kind of conditions to expect, but they don’t determine the route. The real job is understanding which metrics actually reflect value for your product — and then tuning the rest of the system around that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Operational readiness</h3>



<p>No matter how promising the metrics look, scaling a product without engineering readiness is like building on soft ground. Growth puts operational systems under pressure — deployment pipelines, observability tools, latency budgets and release cadences all get stress-tested in real time.  That’s why we treat DORA metrics (like deployment frequency and change failure rate) as early indicators of scaling capacity, not just engineering KPIs.</p>



<p>Before dialing up growth loops, we ask: Are our incident response processes resilient? Do we have error budgets in place, and are they respected? Are performance regressions visible early enough to prevent customer pain?</p>



<p>Scaling isn’t just about acquiring more users — it’s about handling them without breaking trust or stability. Tech debt may not block your next release, but it will compound under pressure. In that sense, infrastructure and platform health are product decisions — because they shape how fast and safely you can move when growth actually arrives.</p>



<p>But metrics don’t just fail at scale because of bad infrastructure — they fail because of how we interpret them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="metric-hygiene">Metric hygiene</h3>



<p>Before any big “results review” meeting or growth update, my team knows I’ll be declaring a data hygiene day. It’s not glamorous, but it’s essential. We verify that key events are tracked correctly, naming is consistent and funnels reflect actual user flows. This habit formed after we celebrated a spike in onboarding — only to later discover it was caused by a faulty event firing too early. That incident taught me the cost of bad data: It creates fake confidence and misleads decision-making. Bad data creates fake confidence – and fake confidence is the most expensive bug of all.</p>



<p>I now treat metric hygiene as seriously as fixing a critical software bug. This isn’t just my eccentricity; it’s borne out by broader evidence. Surveys indicate that 58% of business leaders claim key decisions are often based on inaccurate or inconsistent data. Imagine that – more than half of companies may be betting on wrong numbers, or at least shaky. In the long run, the cost of poor data quality is substantial: A Gartner study reveals that poor data quality costs organizations an average of $15 million annually. Clean metrics are not just technical hygiene — they’re a form of risk management. Before celebrating progress, make sure your measurement system isn’t lying.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="beware-of-proxy-metrics-the-blind-spots-of-growth">Beware of proxy metrics, the ‘blind spots’ of growth</h3>



<p>Not every growing number means you’re winning. In fact, some metrics can grow impressively while masking stagnation or decline in actual value. I call these proxy metrics (or sometimes <em>“blind metrics”</em>). They’re the numbers that give an illusion of success while your core value proposition languishes. Classic examples: App downloads can be skyrocketing, but active usage could be flat. Or page views on your site might be high (perhaps due to clickbait marketing) while conversion to paying customers remains low. We often become <em>metric-blind</em> in these cases: We see the graph going up, but don’t question what it really means.</p>



<p>To stay grounded, I organize metrics in a simple hierarchy — a metric pyramid of sorts. At the base are operational metrics (the day-to-day numbers you can directly control or influence: e.g., number of sales calls made, bugs resolved or marketing spend). In the middle are behavioral or product metrics (these show user behavior and engagement: e.g., daily active users, time spent, feature adoption rates — they result from your operations but aren’t solely under your control).</p>



<p>At the top are outcome metrics, which capture the ultimate goals or the “Why” — often things like revenue, customer retention rate or customer satisfaction that reflect delivered value. This pyramid ensures we connect the tactical metrics to strategic outcomes. It’s similar to the North Star framework many teams use, where a single top-level metric is supported by a few key drivers, and beneath those are a plethora of granular metrics. In fact, product management guides suggest using a metrics pyramid for clarity: At the top you have a North Star outcome, in the middle, the metrics tied to actions you’re taking to influence that outcome, and at the bottom, the finer data points that help troubleshoot and inform decisions.</p>



<p>When I see a metric like “monthly sessions” rising, I force myself to ask: Is this an <em>outcome</em> or just an <em>output</em>? More sessions could mean success <em>if</em> it correlates to the outcome (say, higher revenue or better retention), but it could also be a proxy metric — perhaps users are opening the app more frequently because of a UI change, but not actually getting more value. By structuring our thinking in a pyramid, we remind ourselves that an uptick at the bottom doesn’t guarantee movement at the top.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-myth-of-product-market-fit">The myth of ‘product-market fit’</h3>



<p>In startup lore, few concepts are more celebrated than product-market fit (PMF) — that magical moment when everything clicks: Users love the product, growth surges and you feel like you’ve “made it.” But I’ve grown skeptical of framing PMF as a one-time epiphany. In reality, fit is a moving target — a continuous process, not a milestone. Early traction doesn’t guarantee long-term alignment. Customer needs shift, competitors respond and what fit yesterday might not work tomorrow. That’s why I treat PMF as ongoing calibration, not a finish line.</p>



<p>So instead of chasing a mythical moment, I pay attention to trends and trajectories. Rather than declaring “we have PMF,” I ask: How well are we still solving a real problem for real people — and are we doing it better than alternatives? Teams that endure don’t just find fit once — they continuously refine it.</p>



<p>In fast-paced product cycles, it’s easy to jump from one project to the next without pausing. But I’ve made it a ritual that after every major release or growth experiment, we hold a reflection session. In that session, we ask three questions:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Did we measure the right things?</li>



<li>Which metrics truly gave us clarity, and which ended up misleading or blinding us?</li>



<li>Which of our growth assumptions were proven wrong by reality?</li>
</ol>



<p>I’ve noticed that teams who embrace this reflective practice become much more data-<em>savvy</em> over time. The metrics then stop being a scorecard or cudgel, and become a flashlight — something that illuminates the path forward.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>



<p>If there’s one theme that ties all these lessons together, it’s the importance of consciousness in growth. Frameworks and tactics — North Star metrics, growth loops, viral coefficients, OKRs — all of these are useful tools, but only if wielded with self-awareness and context. I often tell myself and my team: When the numbers say one thing and your context (your intuition, user research, market signals) says another, trust the context.</p>



<p>Growth is an outcome, not a strategy. If I could send advice to my younger self, it would be: Don’t chase the trendline, chase understanding. Ironically, when you truly understand your users and your value, growth tends to follow naturally — and it will be healthier and more sustainable.</p>
