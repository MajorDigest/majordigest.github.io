     <p>The Black Friday deals season is well and truly upon us, and the TechRadar team is working hard finding you the best discounts on the best products across the web. It can be tricky to know when to actually go through with a deal though – especially if there's a chance that the price might drop further over the next day or two.</p><p>Well, retailers have thought of that too, and many of the big names in retail in the US and the UK have policies about refunding the difference if price drops continue. Here's what you need to know about how each retailer approaches it, which should give you more peace of mind as you continue your holiday season shopping.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-amazon"><span>Amazon</span></h3><p>Let's start with the big one – Amazon. We spoke directly to Amazon UK, who told us that it doesn't offer any post-order price adjustments.</p><p>It added that it does try to make its real-time prices as competitive as possible and may sometimes change its prices. However, it won't automatically refund you the difference if something you buy subsequently drops in price during Black Friday week.</p><p>We're still waiting to hear from Amazon US and will update this article when we hear back. However, looking at its customer service policy around price-matching, it's best for US buyers to assume that it's the same situation – there's no price protection guarantee, so don't expect to get a refund if something you bought subsequently drops in price.</p><p>This is a change from previous years, when Amazon has had an automatic process in place (similar to its Pre-Order Price Guarantee) that saw refunds automatically offered if prices for Black Friday Deal products dropped further by a certain date.</p><p>However, Amazon did confirm to us that everything you order from Amazon (except for Amazon Haul items) can be returned within 30 days for a refund – there are more details here on the policy and on the equivalent 30-day returns policy for US buyers.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-other-us-retailers"><span>Other US retailers</span></h3><h3 id="walmart-2">Walmart</h3><p>Walmart is similar to Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Neither Walmart stores or the Walmart website promise to match pricing offered by competitors, or to give you money back if one of your purchases gets discounted further.</p><p>Have a read through the rather comprehensive Walmart Policies and Guidelines page ('Walmart price policy' section), though, and you'll see that Walmart does at least promise to match prices in store to those on its website.</p><h3 id="best-buy-2">Best Buy</h3><p>The Best Buy price match guarantee is one of the best around: The retailer will honor a refund if something you've bought drops to a lower price, either at Best Buy or a select number of competitors: you just need to get in touch with them.</p><p>However, some products are excluded, such as items from third-party sellers or with third-party contracts, so make sure you check before buying.</p><h3 id="newegg-2">Newegg</h3><p>Newegg has a Black Friday Price Protection deal in place, and it's refreshingly simple: if the price drops on something you've purchased, you get the money back.</p><p>However, it needs to have a Black Friday Price Protection badge on it when you're making the purchase, and the offer only runs until the end of November 29 – so Cyber Monday isn't covered by it.</p><h3 id="target-2">Target</h3><p>Target has a price match guarantee in place for the holiday season, and will price correct for you if you buy something that then is available at a lower price later on.</p><p>As you'll see from the link, it's pretty simple, but you do need proof of purchase and there are exceptions – including items bought from stores and included in promotion bundles.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-uk-retailers"><span>UK retailers</span></h3><h3 id="currys-2">Currys</h3><p>Currys does offer a Black Friday price guarantee, which simply means that if you order something that then goes down in price over Black Friday, you can claim back the difference.</p><p>It's an appealing offer, but it was only active between 29 October and 18 November – so you needed to have registered well in advance of Black Friday to claim.</p><h3 id="argos-2">Argos</h3><p>Argos also offers a Black Friday price guarantee, and this one does run right through until 25 December.</p><p>If something you've bought drops in price again, you can get the difference as a credit to use at Argos – however, the product must have a 'price guarantee' badge on it, which based on our quick scan, is shown on some but not all of the discount deals. So again, check before you hit that 'buy' button.</p><h3 id="john-lewis-2">John Lewis</h3><p>John Lewis has a price promise policy that means it'll refund you the difference if something you bought in the last seven days subsequently becomes cheaper at one of the 25 retailers it price matches with (which includes John Lewis itself).</p><p>However, there are a few stipulations – John Lewis says it will "price match some offers and promotions but not reduced to clear", so you'll need to be careful when buying and also complete this form to see if you're eligible for a refund on the difference. The product "can be on seasonal offer or promotion".</p><p>That form shows you the other retailers that John Lewis price matches with (for example, it includes Amazon but "electricals only") and the store says it'll get back to you "within 48 hours" of completing the form.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.
