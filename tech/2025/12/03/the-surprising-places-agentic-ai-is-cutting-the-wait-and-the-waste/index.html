<p>I have spent most of my career accountable for the parts of technology nobody thinks about until something breaks. Service delivery, back-office workflows, knowledge decay, compliance friction and the invisible handoffs that quietly drain budgets. For years, I invested in automation as the answer to operational drag. We built rules, mapped flows and tried to automate the edge cases. But whenever reality changed, those automations snapped. It took me longer to realize I was automating drift.</p>



<p>Agentic AI changes the equation by introducing autonomy, adaptability and multi-step reasoning based on a deep understanding of context. It can escalate when confidence falls and apply policy dynamically. Over the past two years, I have deployed agentic capabilities across IT operations and talent acquisition. The cost savings were real, but the reduction in operational risk mattered more.</p>



<p>What concerns me most is how quickly interest is outpacing understanding. A recent enterprise AI maturity study found that many organizations are considering adopting agentic AI in the next 12 months, yet far fewer report being deeply familiar with AI technology. There is widening daylight between investment and comprehension, and leaders can feel it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-hidden-economics-of-back-office-drag">The hidden economics of back-office drag</h3>



<p>Service delivery is accounted for as a cost center, but in practice, it behaves like a risk center. When incidents spike, I burn labor hours and credibility. When change freezes, innovation slows. When knowledge walks out the door, complexity compounds. Research from McKinsey estimates that major incident outages can cost more than $300,000 per hour when accounting for downtime, lost productivity and recovery labor. Outages erode trust as quickly as they drain budgets, and the longer the system stays down, the more stakeholders begin to question leadership’s judgment rather than the failure itself.</p>



<p>Agentic AI gave me ways to address root causes rather than symptoms. It accelerated the pace at which risk surfaced and reduced the dependence on human memory to carry operational knowledge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-service-automation-that-actually-bends-cost-curves">IT service automation that actually bends cost curves</h3>



<p>The first breakthrough came from reducing low-value, high-volume work. Password resets, access requests, policy clarification and device troubleshooting represented a disproportionate share of tickets. Conversational agents served as the first point of contact, recognizing intent, authenticating users, enforcing policy and triggering workflows. The response someone received at 4 p.m. on a weekday became indistinguishable from the one they received at 2 a.m.</p>



<p>As these agents matured, they evolved beyond conversation. Diagnostic agents pulled logs and compared them to historical incident signatures. Identity agents validated entitlements through policy. Remediation agents performed corrective actions autonomously when confidence thresholds were high enough. The agents could reason, plan and act instead of merely responding.</p>



<p>I also deployed agents that assisted human analysts. They summarized lengthy ticket histories, suggested relevant knowledge articles and drafted follow-up communication. They even generated new content as knowledge articles from closed incidents to expand self-service coverage. This type of coexistence shifted work away from repetition and toward judgment.</p>



<p>In parallel, autonomous agents operated inside infrastructure operations. They validated alerts, correlated telemetry and occasionally took action before anyone knew an issue existed. It was not about removing humans. It was about removing hours of manual investigation that added no value.</p>



<p>These moves consistently reduced incident resolution times. Industry benchmarks already show double-digit percentage decreases in resolution duration when agentic orchestration is applied to major incidents. I saw similar patterns. The improvement compounds because every minute saved in response time reduces the blast radius downstream.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strengthening-compliance-and-finance-through-continuous-automation">Strengthening compliance and finance through continuous automation</h3>



<p>Compliance workflows suffer when human memory carries the load. Before AI, teams stored rules in shared folders and hallway conversations. Today, compliance agents reconcile invoices, validate contract terms and flag anomalies proactively. They create explainable audit trails continuously rather than quarterly. NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework highlights traceability and explainability as foundational principles. Implementing those controls early reduced anxiety across audit teams and replaced after-the-fact cleanup with preventive action. This also reduced risk and elevated compliance reporting.</p>



<p>Finance experienced something similar. Reconciliation agents monitored variances and surfaced unusual patterns. What surprised me most was their reaction. They were not afraid of replacement. They were afraid of errors. When automation reduced manual variance, they became vocal advocates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="finding-use-cases-through-process-mapping">Finding use cases through process mapping</h3>



<p>One of the most practical methods for identifying where agentic AI can help is process mapping. When I began visualizing workflows end-to-end, bottlenecks became obvious. Process mining tools uncovered rework loops, approval delays and exception handling that never made it onto formal documentation. Seeing work as a series of minor frictions makes it easier to understand where agents can step in.</p>



<p>The most compelling results emerged when agents were orchestrated together. A conversational agent collected symptoms and authenticated the user. A diagnostic agent pulled logs. A knowledge agent suggested resolutions based on pattern similarity. A remediation agent executed the corrective action. An orchestration layer coordinated all of it. That is where the returns accelerate.</p>



<p>Organizations that have leaned into this approach have reported dramatic improvements in self-submitted HR requests, faster employee onboarding and higher satisfaction due to real-time knowledge enrichment. This reinforces a simple truth: removing friction creates participation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="workflow-orchestration-reduces-cross-function-friction">Workflow orchestration reduces cross-function friction</h3>



<p>Most operational drag does not come from incidents. It comes from handoffs. Procurement requests that are bounced between finance, IT and security. Access approvals that depend on availability rather than policy. Tickets that accumulate because approvers are out of office or lack clarity. These interactions create delay and noise that nobody can see on a dashboard.</p>



<p>Orchestration agents change that dynamic. They trigger conditional workflows, collect missing information, validate approvals against policy and route requests without human intervention. Approval agents enforce thresholds. Inventory agents check asset life cycle status. Risk agents flag questionable suppliers. Tasks that previously took days now close in hours. And reducing interruptions had the same effect on productivity as adding headcount.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-i-do-not-build-foundation-models-from-scratch">Why I do not build foundation models from scratch</h3>



<p>At one point, I considered building a model internally. The idea was tempting. Owning the entire stack felt like a strategic advantage. But foundation models require massive compute, specialized research talent and years of iteration. Instead, I licensed access to best-in-class models and built the agentic layer on top. We used retrieval-augmented generation to feed proprietary documents and policy rules into the model, then layered business logic that governed behavior in context. We designed this with a strong emphasis on data governance, access control and privacy protection to ensure data was handled responsibly and in compliance with regulations.</p>



<p>This hybrid buy-and-enhance approach delivered faster time-to-value, reduced technical risk and allowed us to retain control of proprietary data and logic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-i-would-build-instead-of-buy">When I would build instead of buy</h3>



<p>There are scenarios where owning the full stack makes sense. If AI is central to strategic product differentiation, if data cannot leave owned infrastructure, if regulatory constraints demand full control or if internal AI engineering maturity is high, then building becomes rational rather than romantic. MIT Sloan has explored the productivity paradox of AI, noting that capability without maturity can increase cost rather than reduce it. That matched my experience.</p>



<p>It is also important to recognize that both data and process maturity must be at a high bar before considering custom agentic development. Automating a broken or incomplete process does not eliminate chaos; it multiplies it. Inadequate governance, missing metadata, inconsistent runbooks or contradictory policies will produce unpredictable outcomes at machine speed. AI does not fix drift. It amplifies whatever it touches. When the substrate is clean, autonomy accelerates value. When it is not, it collapses into noise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="agentic-ai-in-talent-acquisition-was-the-unexpected-hero">Agentic AI in talent acquisition was the unexpected hero</h3>



<p>The biggest lift I saw came from HR. Application backlogs caused candidates to drop off. Interview scheduling created friction across time zones. Compensation exceptions slowed approvals. Agentic AI addressed all three. Conversational agents guide candidates through application steps. Scheduling agents reconciled calendars, set up interviews and sent confirmations. Qualification agents screened resumes against policy. Sentiment agents summarized tone and engagement from written and verbal communication, providing summaries of conversations to all parties.</p>



<p>Time-to-fill decreased and candidate satisfaction improved simply by eliminating the waiting. The SHRM Candidate Application Abandonment Study notes that delayed response time is one of the top drivers of candidate abandonment. Agents save time. And when you compress cycle time in recruiting, you increase talent density, which later reduces operational drag across the enterprise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cost-is-shifting-from-labor-to-compute">Cost is shifting from labor to compute</h3>



<p>When human workload decreases, inference cost rises. Finance teams are not yet fluent in ROC (return on compute), but this metric will become as common as ROI. Without guardrails, cloud cost drift can quietly consume the savings that automation promised. I track ROC as closely as I track cost per ticket because unmonitored inference is the new runaway labor. Compute cycles do not call in sick or take a vacation and they scale without asking permission.</p>



<p>This is where leaders can get fooled. If compute spend rises faster than human workload declines, autonomy without financial guardrails can turn cloud cost into the new labor balloon — just harder to see, harder to attribute and harder to challenge. The danger is that it hides in budgets where executives are not trained to look. Leaders know how to question headcount, overtime and contractor spend, but they rarely scrutinize the compute charges buried in cloud bills. AI costs grow in technical corners of the budget, where they can expand quietly and avoid the financial scrutiny applied to labor.</p>



<p>In the same way cloud transformed capital expense into operating expense overnight, agentic AI will force us to treat compute as a strategic cost center rather than a utility. If we do not build that discipline now, autonomy will become the most elegant form of overspending we have ever engineered.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-success-looks-like">What success looks like</h3>



<p>In mature environments, I saw fewer escalations, shorter outages, improved hiring velocity and predictable change cycles. Operational friction decreased and innovation increased. Teams felt less interrupted and more trusted. That cultural shift was as valuable as the financial one.</p>



<p>Predictability is the real outcome. When service delivery becomes stable and repeatable, IT stops acting like an internal repair shop and starts behaving like an engine of growth. Reliable delivery creates the headroom to build new products, partner with the business on revenue initiatives and invest in automations that compound value instead of compensating for failure. As the operational noise floor drops, capacity shifts from firefighting to forward motion.</p>



<p>Agentic AI is not just about doing the same work cheaper. It is about creating the conditions where IT can participate in strategy, influence the customer experience and build digital capabilities that generate revenue rather than support it. When systems stop surprising us, we can finally focus on the work that moves the company forward.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="final-thought">Final thought</h3>



<p>Agentic AI is not about replacing judgment. It is about protecting it. When machines remove drag, humans spend more time on the decisions that matter. The organizations that treat back-office operations as a resilience discipline, not a cost bucket, will bend cost curves and compress risk where it quietly accumulates.</p>
