     <p>Every seven days we put together an ICYMI (In Case You Missed It) round-up like this one, so you can cast an eye over the most important stories that happened in tech land since this time last week – and once again, it's been another busy week of news and reviews.</p><p>We've got everything from GTA 6 leaks to a mammoth deal that sees Netflix picking up Warner Bros. Discovery for a huge sum of money – with a 360-degree drone review, the launch of Spotify Wrapped 2025, and more stories also included along the way.</p><p>Our advice would be to get settled and get ready to digest this rundown of tech news tales, shaping the industry and almost every part of our lives. No doubt there will be more stories to come over the next seven days as well – we'll see you again this time next week.</p><h3 id="7-another-gta-6-leak-got-us-excited-and-impatient-2">7. Another GTA 6 leak got us excited and impatient</h3><p>No other video game is as eagerly anticipated as GTA 6 right now. And while the launch of the game was recently delayed to November 2026, we do have a new leak to talk about: a leak that supposedly reveals some of the scenes that might feature in the upcoming title. This apparently comes from an animator who previously worked at Rockstar.</p><p>The scenes show Lucia, one of the main characters, jumping into the bed of a pickup truck, and an unidentified character picking up a bicycle from a rental station – perhaps hinting at a couple of the ways players will be able to get around in the game. They're interesting, but what we'd really like to see is another trailer please Rockstar, if you're reading...</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> GTA 6 leak supposedly from former Rockstar animator gives us fresh morsels of gameplay footage</li></ul><h3 id="6-the-commodore-64-returned-to-production-after-a-30-year-break-2">6. The Commodore 64 returned to production after a 30-year break</h3><p>How strong is your sense of computing nostalgia? The classic Commodore 64 is back in production for the first time in three decades, and while the system is incredibly dated compared to our modern day gadgets, there's something about it that makes it appealing – and it has been updated with some modern options, including Ethernet and HDMI.</p><p>You'll be able to play your old cartridges and disks on this new version, and in total there's support for more than 10,000 original games (and you get plenty bundled with the device itself). Preorders are open now, and the basic version of the new (but retro) system will set you back $299.99 (around £225 / AU$450) – you can find more details on the updated Commodore website.</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> The Commodore 64 is back on the production line for the first time in 30 years – and I want it, even if it makes zero sense</li></ul><h3 id="5-we-reviewed-the-world-s-first-360-drone-2">5. We reviewed the world’s first 360 drone</h3><p>Today's drones are capable of capturing some fantastic videos and photos – but what if you fitted a 360-degree camera to one? That's the idea behind the new Antigravity A1, the first model we've seen with a full 360-degree perspective on the world. We've been thoroughly testing the new drone, to see if it's as good as its premise might suggest.</p><p>In short: it's an appealing piece of kit for drone enthusiasts. Our review talks about "impressive innovation" and an "immersive flying experience", offering "many creative possibilities" – although it's going to cost you a significant amount of money. Click through for our full review and all the details on everything from camera quality to battery life.</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> I tested the Antigravity 360 drone – and only a sky-high price tag brings this unique DJI rival down to earth</li></ul><h3 id="4-the-yearly-recaps-landed-including-spotify-wrapped-2025-2">4. The yearly recaps landed – including Spotify Wrapped 2025</h3><p>We've been hit by a barrage of yearly recaps this week – led by Spotify Wrapped 2025, but also including the Apple Music Replay 2025, and the YouTube Recap 2025, which is the first we've seen from the video-sharing platform. If you were wondering where all your screen time went over the last 12 months, then these various round-ups will fill you in.</p><p>When it comes to Spotify Wrapped 2025, there's more data included than ever before, including a list of your top albums and a fan leaderboard that compares you to other listeners. There's an interactive game you can play to compare your listening habits against those of your friends, and an AI-powered deep dive into specific days as well.</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> Spotify Wrapped 2025 has landed – here's how to find it, plus the best new features this year</li></ul><h3 id="3-sony-launched-its-best-camera-ever-and-we-reviewed-it-2">3. Sony launched its best camera ever – and we reviewed it</h3><p>Also on the review bench at TechRadar this week: the Sony A7 V. As the attached five-star rating will tell you, the successor to the popular Sony A7 IV is a fantastic digital camera, and is sure to appeal to a broad range of photographers who are prepared to pay to get the best hardware in the business (although it's probably a bit much for complete beginners).</p><p>With phrases like "another huge step forward" and "exceptional image quality", our detailed Sony A7 V review tells you everything you need to know about this camera – including how it compares to other top models in terms of design, price, and performance. If you're looking for a serious upgrade for your photo kit, you might just have found it.</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> I tested the new Sony A7 V, and now it's my favorite Sony camera ever</li></ul><h3 id="2-samsung-finally-revealed-its-galaxy-trifold-2">2. Samsung finally revealed its Galaxy TriFold</h3><p>It's been a long wait for the tri-fold phone from Samsung – remember the device was first teased all the way back in January – but it's now official, and it's called the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold. It's available in South Korea now, and it's coming to the US at the start of next year (though we're still not sure what it's going to cost in international markets).</p><p>It's your standard foldable, with another hinge and screen section attached – so you really are carrying a tablet around in your pocket. It looks as though Samsung has tried to make the device as thin and lightweight as possible, and the specs that have been revealed are very much flagship level. In fact, it sounds like something of an engineering marvel.</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> Samsung unveils the Galaxy Z Trifold, a foldable that lives up to its name</li></ul><h3 id="1-netflix-drew-gasps-with-its-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2">1. Netflix drew gasps with its Warner Bros. Discovery deal</h3><p>There's no doubt about the biggest news of the week: Netflix has agreed a deal to pick up Warner Bros. Discovery for a cool $82.7 billion, which will give it access to its very own movie studio, as well as everything produced by HBO and HBO Max. There's a lot of content and intellectual property included here, and we're still taking it all in.</p><p>While Netflix is promising lots of benefits for consumers, we can't help but worry about higher prices for streaming services and shorter theatrical runs for movies in actual physical theaters. There are a lot of unanswered questions about what happens next, but we've covered everything about the blockbuster deal that's been announced so far.</p><ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> Netflix agrees $82.7 billion deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery – and claims it’ll result in 'more choice and greater value for consumers'</li></ul><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&gl=GB&ceid=GB%3Aen"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a><em> and </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.
