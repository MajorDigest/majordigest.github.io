<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>More processor coverage on Network World:<br>AMD news and insights | Nvidia news and insights</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Intel is hoping for a turnaround under its new CEO, Lip-BuTan.  Intel’s Q1 2025 revenue was $12.7 billion, flat year-over-year. While its Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue dropped 8%, the Data Center and AI (DCAI) segment showed an 8% increase, driven by Xeon volume.</p>



<p>Intel is pushing its Gaudi 3 AI accelerators and report that it’s on track for volume production of its Intel 18A process technology in the second half of 2025, a critical step in its attempt to regain manufacturing leadership. This 18A node will underpin future products like Panther Lake CPUs, expected in the second  half of 2025.</p>



<p>The company is investing in the AI PC segment with its Core Ultra processors, focusing on on-device AI capabilities and a broader AI Everywhere strategy. Intel’s strategy hinges on improving execution, driving operational efficiencies (targeting $17 billion in operating expenses for 2025, down from previous goals), and rapidly scaling its foundry business (Intel Foundry Services – IFS) to become a major contract manufacturer.</p>
