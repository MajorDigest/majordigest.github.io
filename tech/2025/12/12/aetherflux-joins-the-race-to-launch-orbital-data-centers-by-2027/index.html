<p>Aetherflux says it will launch its first solar powered orbital data center satellite in the first quarter of 2027, joining SpaceX, Amazon, Google, and Starcloud in a race to move computing infrastructure off-planet as AI’s energy demands outpace terrestrial data center capacity.</p>



<p>“Aetherflux’s first data center node for commercial use is targeted for Q1 2027; subsequent satellite launches will build a constellation of nodes to scale capacity,” Aetherflux said in an announcement of the project, dubbed “Galactic Brain.”</p>



<p>The push reflects AI’s mounting pressure on data center infrastructure. Data center energy consumption is expected to double by 2030, according to World Economic Forum estimates. Goldman Sachs projects that power demand will be even higher, surging 160% by 2030.</p>



<p>Yet fewer than one in ten CIOs have included orbital computing in their three-to-five-year roadmaps, even though more than six in ten cite power, land, and permitting as top constraints on AI infrastructure, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research, citing the firm’s data.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="company-outlines-technical-approach">Company outlines technical approach</h3>



<p>Aetherflux’s first node will provide “multi-gigabit level bandwidth,” with availability comparable to terrestrial servers through leveraging of optical inter-satellite links and emerging relay networks, a company spokesperson told <em>NetworkWorld</em>.</p>



<p>“Our roadmap begins with the deployment of teraflop-class systems in 2027,” the spokesperson said. “We are designing the architecture to scale rapidly to petaflop-class constellations as we increase the number of deployed nodes.”</p>



<p>Enterprises will connect to and manage orbital workloads “the same way they manage cloud workloads today,” using optical links, the spokesperson added. The company’s approach is to “continuously launch new hardware and quickly integrate the latest architectures,” with older systems running lower-priority tasks to serve out the full useful lifetime of their high-end GPUs. The company declined to disclose pricing.</p>



<p>Aetherflux plans to launch about 30 satellites at a time on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets. Before the data center launch, the company will launch a power-beaming demonstration satellite in 2026 to test transmission of one kilowatt of energy from orbit to ground stations, using infrared lasers.</p>



<p>Competition in the sector has intensified in recent months. In November, Starcloud launched its Starcloud-1 satellite carrying an Nvidia H100 GPU, which is 100 times more powerful than any previous GPU flown in space, according to the company, and demonstrated running Google’s Gemma AI model in orbit. In the same month, Google announced Project Suncatcher, with a 2027 demonstration mission planned.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="analysts-see-limited-near-term-applications">Analysts see limited near-term applications</h3>



<p>Despite the competitive activity, orbital data centers won’t replace terrestrial cloud regions for general hosting through 2030, said Ashish Banerjee, senior principal analyst at Gartner. Instead, they suit specific workloads, including meeting data sovereignty requirements for jurisdictionally complex scenarios, offering disaster recovery immune to terrestrial risks, and providing asynchronous high-performance computing, he said.</p>



<p>“Orbital centers are ideal for high-compute, low-I/O batch jobs,” Banerjee said. “Think molecular folding simulations for pharma, massive Monte Carlo financial simulations, or training specific AI model weights. If the job takes 48 hours, the 500ms latency penalty of LEO is irrelevant.”</p>



<p>One immediate application involves processing satellite-generated data in orbit, he said. Earth observation satellites using synthetic aperture radar generate roughly 10 gigabytes per second, but limited downlink bandwidth creates bottlenecks. Processing data in orbit and transmitting only results could reduce latency and communication costs, he said.</p>



<p>Space-suitable workloads share three characteristics, Banerjee said: low data transfer requirements, latency tolerance, and high energy intensity.</p>



<p>Gogia echoed the limited scope. “Core banking, e-commerce, ERP, collaboration, and most analytics will remain resolutely terrestrial,” he said. “Those systems are tightly coupled to user interaction, regulatory controls and existing data gravity.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cost-barriers-remain-substantial">Cost barriers remain substantial</h3>



<p>The notion that the cost of energy in space is almost zero “has merit, but is economically dangerous if taken in isolation,” Banerjee said. Terrestrial data centers have high operational expenses for power and cooling but moderate capital expenses. In orbit, energy operational costs approach zero but capital expenses are astronomical, he said.</p>



<p>“You must build the power plant—solar arrays—and build the cooling tower—radiators—and launch all of it at thousands of dollars per kilogram,” Banerjee explained.</p>



<p>Launch costs pose a major hurdle. Google’s research indicated costs must fall below $200 per kilogram by the mid-2030s for orbital data centers to match terrestrial facilities on cost. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 currently charges around $2,500 per kilogram.</p>



<p>Hardware refresh compounds the challenge. On Earth, enterprises refresh hardware every three to five years. In space, hardware can’t be upgraded once launched, Banerjee said.</p>



<p>“If Aetherflux launches H100 GPUs in 2027, by 2030 they’re obsolete artifacts,” he said. “Orbital providers must treat satellites as disposable—launching new clusters annually—which drastically inflates total cost of ownership.”</p>



<p>Cooling adds another cost layer. In vacuum, cooling occurs only through radiation, requiring massive radiator panels. Every kilogram of radiator adds to launch costs, eroding savings from free solar energy, he said.</p>



<p>Given these challenges, more than 70% of CIOs said they need at least a 30% to 40% total cost advantage before considering orbital options, Gogia said, citing Greyhound Research data.</p>



<p>Despite the obstacles, market projections remain bullish. BIS Research projects the in-orbit data center market will reach $1.77 billion in 2029, and $39.09 billion by 2035.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="timeline-expectations-differ-sharply">Timeline expectations differ sharply</h3>



<p>“The timelines being marketed are best read as ambitious markers, not planning anchors for CIOs,” Gogia said. “Realistic enterprise pilots for production-grade workloads are more likely toward the very end of this decade.”</p>



<p>For network architects planning infrastructure, orbital computing should be treated as an ultra-remote specialist region loosely coupled to existing systems, he added, since response times remain in tens of milliseconds—acceptable for batch AI training but unsuitable for transaction systems.</p>



<p>Banerjee framed the value proposition differently. “IT leaders must treat orbital compute not as a cost-savings play, but as a sustainability and availability play,” he said. “You’re not going to space to save money on your cloud bill. You’re going there to access 500 megawatts of green power that your state’s grid simply cannot give you.”</p>



<p>For now, both analysts recommended caution. “For the next three to five years, orbital data centers should sit firmly in scenario planning, not as a dependency in core transformation programs,” Gogia said.</p>
