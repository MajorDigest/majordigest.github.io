<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="infoworld-celebrates-the-years-best-products">InfoWorld celebrates the year’s best products</h3>



<p>From AI-powered coding assistants to real-time analytics engines, the software stack is undergoing its biggest shakeup in decades. Generative AI (genAI) and agentic AI tools are redefining how code is written, tested, and deployed — even as experts debate the true productivity gains they facilitate. Data management is converging around unified lakehouse architectures, the Apache Iceberg table format, and streaming technologies such as Apache Kafka, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insight. On virtually every front, from application programming interface (API) development to cloud security, new platforms promise automated intelligence and tighter governance, signaling a new era in which innovation and control must evolve in tandem.</p>



<p>Examples of this innovative era are prominent among the 99 finalists and 35 winners of InfoWorld’s 2025 Technology of the Year Awards.</p>



<p>The InfoWorld Technology of the Year Awards recognize the best and most innovative products in AI, APIs, applications, business intelligence (BI), cloud, data management, devops, and software development. Read on to meet our finalists and winners.</p>

<p>With Harness’s Cloud Web Application and API Protection (WAAP), enterprises get end-to-end API security without slowing development. It eliminates blind spots, stops advanced attacks in real time, and plugs directly into CI/CD [continuous integration and continuous delivery] so security becomes part of delivery.</p>



<p>Cloud WAAP continuously discovers and maps every API (including shadow and third-party); analyzes live traffic and data sensitivity to assess risk; and actively protects against fraud, attacks, abuse, and DDoS [distributed denial of services] threats. One platform unifies discovery, testing, and runtime defense, giving teams a real-time searchable view of their API estate and the controls to act.</p>

<p>Observo AI is an AI-powered data pipeline that transforms how enterprises manage security and observability. It analyzes telemetry data from security and devops tools, using machine learning and agentic AI to flag anomalies; detect privacy risks; perform data transformations; and strip irrelevant data from cloud flow, firewall, operating system, CDN [content delivery network], and application logs.</p>



<p>What sets Observo AI apart is its flexible, non-scripted automation. Instead of asking users to manually write and maintain thousands of inflexible rules, Observo’s ML models automatically detect schemas, summarize normal events, and enrich data with contextual intelligence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-the-judges">From the judges</h3>



<p>“Observo AI addresses one of the hardest problems in security by moving beyond brittle rule-based pipelines to adaptive machine learning and agentic automation. It redefines how telemetry pipelines are built and managed, putting it ahead of competitors that are still bound by static rules.”</p>
