<p>Django is a one-size-fits-all Python web framework that was inspired by Ruby on Rails and uses many of the same metaphors to make web development fast and easy. Fully loaded and flexible, Django has become one of Python’s most widely used web frameworks.</p>



<p>Now in version 6.0, Django includes virtually everything you need to build a web application of any size, and its popularity makes it easy to find examples and help for various scenarios. Plus, Django provides tools to allow your application to evolve and add features gracefully, and to migrate its data schema if there is one.</p>



<p>Django also has a reputation for being complex, with many components and a good deal of “under the hood” configuration required. In truth, you can use Django to get a simple Python application up and running in relatively short order, then expand its functionality as needed.</p>



<p>This article guides you through creating a basic application using Django 6.0. We’ll also touch on the most crucial features for web developers in the Django 6 release.</p>



<aside class="sidebar large">
<h3 id="what-version-of-python-do-i-need">What version of Python do I need?</h3>
<p>To install Django 6.0, you will need Python 3.12 or better. Ideally, you should use the most recent Python version that supports everything you want to do with your Django project, but in some cases, it may not be possible to update. If you’re stuck with an earlier version of Python, you may be able to use Django 5. Consult Django’s Python version table to find out which versions you can use.</p>
</aside>




<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="installing-django">Installing Django</h3>



<p>Assuming you have Python 3.12 or higher installed, the first step to installing Django is to create a virtual environment. Installing Django in the venv keeps Django and its associated libraries separate from your base Python installation, which is always a good practice.</p>



<aside class="sidebar large">
<h3 id="note-about-venvs">Note about venvs</h3>
<p>Note that you do not need to use virtual environments to create multiple projects using a single instance of Django. You only need them to isolate different point revisions of the Django framework, each with different projects.</p>
</aside>




<p>Next, install Django in your chosen virtual environment via Python’s <code>pip</code> utility:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pip install django</code></pre>



<p>This installs the core Django libraries and the <code>django-admin</code> command-line utility used to manage Django projects.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="creating-a-new-django-project">Creating a new Django project</h3>



<p>Django instances are organized into two tiers: <em>projects</em> and <em>apps</em>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A <em>project</em> is an instance of Django with its own database configuration, settings, and apps. It’s best to think of a project as a place to store all the site-level configurations you’ll use.</li>



<li>An <em>app</em> is a subdivision of a project, with its own route and rendering logic. Multiple apps can be placed in a single Django project.</li>
</ul>



<p>To create a new Django project from scratch, activate the virtual environment where you have Django installed. Then enter the directory where you want to store the project and type:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>django-admin startproject <project_name></code></pre>



<p>The <code><project_name></code> is the name of both the project and the subdirectory where the project will be stored. Be sure to pick a name that isn’t likely to collide with a name used by Python or Django internally. A name like <code>myproj</code> works well.</p>



<p>The newly created directory should contain a <code>manage.py</code> file, which is used to control the app’s behavior from the command line, along with another subdirectory (also with the project name) that contains the following files:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An <code>__init__.py</code> file, which is used by Python to designate a subdirectory as a code module.</li>



<li><code>settings.py</code>, which holds the settings used for the project. Many of the most common settings will be pre-populated for you.</li>



<li><code>urls.py</code>, which lists the routes or URLs available to your Django project, or that the project will return responses for.</li>



<li><code>wsgi.py</code>, which is used by WSGI-compatible web servers, such as Apache HTTP or Nginx, to serve your project’s apps.</li>



<li><code>asgi.py</code>, which is used by ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project’s apps. ASGI is a relatively new standard for asynchronous servers and applications, and requires a server that supports it, like <code>uvicorn</code>. Django only recently added native support for asynchronous applications, which will also need to be hosted on an async-compatible server to be fully effective.</li>
</ul>



<p>Next, test the project to ensure it’s functioning. From the command line in the directory containing your project’s <code>manage.py</code> file, enter:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>python manage.py runserver</code></pre>



<p>This should start a development web server available at <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code>. Visit that link and you should see a simple welcome page that tells you the installation was successful.</p>



<p>Note that the development web server should <em>not</em> be used to serve a Django project to the public. It’s solely for local testing and is not designed to scale for public-facing applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="creating-a-django-application">Creating a Django application</h3>



<p>Next, we’ll create an application inside of this project. Navigate to the same directory as <code>manage.py</code> and issue the following command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>python manage.py startapp myapp</code></pre>



<p>This creates a subdirectory for an application named <code>myapp</code> that contains the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A migrations directory: Contains code used to migrate the site between versions of its data schema. Django projects typically have a database, so the schema for the database—including changes to the schema—is managed as part of the project.</li>



<li><code>admin.py</code>: Contains objects used by Django’s built-in administration tools. If your app has an admin interface or privileged users, you will configure the related objects here.</li>



<li><code>apps.py</code>: Provides configuration information about the app to the project at large, by way of an <code>AppConfig</code> object.</li>



<li><code>models.py</code>: Contains objects that define data structures, used by your app to interface with databases.</li>



<li><code>tests.py</code>: Contains any tests created by you and used to ensure that your site’s functions and modules are working as intended.</li>



<li><code>views.py</code>: Contains functions that render and return responses.</li>
</ul>



<p>To start working with the application, you need to first register it with the project. Edit <code>myproj/settings.py</code> as follows, adding a line to the top of the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> list:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "myapp.apps.MyappConfig",
    "django.contrib.admin",
    ...
</code></pre>



<p>If you look in <code>myproj/myapp/apps.py</code>, you’ll see a pre-generated object named <code>MyappConfig</code>, which we’ve referenced here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adding-routes-and-views-to-your-django-application">Adding routes and views to your Django application</h3>



<p>Django applications follow a basic pattern for processing requests:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When an incoming request is received, Django parses the URL for a <em>route</em> to apply it to.</li>



<li>Routes are defined in <code>urls.py</code>, with each route linked to a <em>view</em>, meaning a function that returns data to be sent back to the client. Views can be located anywhere in a Django project, but they’re best organized into their own modules.</li>



<li>Views can contain the results of a <em>template</em>, which is code that formats requested data according to a certain design.</li>
</ul>



<p>To get an idea of how all these pieces fit together, let’s modify the default route of our sample application to return a custom message.</p>



<p>Routes are defined in <code>urls.py</code>, in a list named <code>urlpatterns</code>. If you open the sample <code>urls.py</code>, you’ll see <code>urlpatterns</code> already predefined:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
</code></pre>



<p>The <code>path</code> function (a Django built-in) takes a route and a view function as arguments and generates a reference to a URL path. By default, Django creates an <code>admin</code> path that is used for site administration, but we need to create our own routes.</p>



<p>Add another entry, so that the whole file looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls'))
]
</code></pre>



<p>The <code>include</code> function tells Django to look for more route pattern information in the file <code>myapp.urls</code>. All routes found in that file will be attached to the top-level route <code>myapp</code> (e.g., <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/myapp</code>).</p>



<p>Next, create a new <code>urls.py</code> in <code>myapp</code> and add the following:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index)
]</code></pre>



<p>Django prepends a slash to the beginning of each URL, so to specify the root of the site (<code>/</code>), we just supply a blank string as the URL.</p>



<p>Now, edit the file <code>myapp/views.py</code> so it looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
</code></pre>



<p><code>django.http.HttpResponse</code> is a Django built-in that generates an HTTP response from a supplied string. Note that <code>request</code>, which contains the information for an incoming HTTP request, must be passed as the first parameter to a view function.</p>



<p>Stop and restart the development server, and navigate to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/</code>. You should see “”Hello, world!” appear in the browser.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adding-routes-with-variables-in-django">Adding routes with variables in Django</h3>



<p>Django can accept routes that incorporate variables as part of their syntax. Let’s say you wanted to accept URLs that had the format <code>year/<int:year></code>. You could accomplish that by adding the following entry to <code>urlpatterns</code>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>path(‘year/’, views.year)</code></pre>



<p>The view function <code>views.year</code> would then be invoked through routes like <code>year/1996</code>, <code>year/2010</code>, and so on, with the variable year passed as a parameter to <code>views.year</code>.</p>



<p>To try this out for yourself, add the above <code>urlpatterns</code> entry to <code>myapp/urls.py</code>, then add this function to <code>myapp/views.py</code>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
def year(request, year):
    return HttpResponse('Year: {}'.format(year))
    </code></pre>



<p>If you navigate to <code>/myapp/year/2010</code> on your site, you should see <code>Year: 2010</code> displayed in response. Note that routes like <code>/myapp/year/rutabaga</code> will yield an error because the <code>int:</code> constraint on the variable year allows only an integer in that position. Many other formatting options are available for routes.</p>



<aside class="sidebar large">
<h3 id="backward-compatibility-with-older-django-routes">Backward compatibility with older Django routes</h3>
<p>Earlier versions of Django had a more complex syntax for routes, which was difficult to parse. If you still need to add routes using the old syntax—for instance, for backward compatibility with an old Django project—you can use the django.urls.re_path function, which matches routes using regular expressions.</p>
</aside>




<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="django-templates-and-template-partials">Django templates and template partials</h3>



<p>You can use Django’s built-in template language to generate web pages from data.</p>



<p>Templates used by Django apps are stored in a directory that is central to the project: <code><app_name>/templates/<app_name>/</code>. For our <code>myapp</code> project, the directory would be <code>myapp/templates/myapp/</code>. This directory structure may seem awkward, but allowing Django to look for templates in multiple places avoids name collisions between templates with the same name across multiple apps.</p>



<p>In your <code>myapp/templates/myapp/</code> directory, create a file named <code>year.html</code> with the following content:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Year: {{year}}</code></pre>



<p>Any value within double curly braces in a template is treated as a variable. Everything else is treated literally.</p>



<p>Modify <code>myapp/views.py</code> to look like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")

def year(request, year):
    data = {'year':year}
    return render(request, 'myapp/year.html', data)
</code></pre>



<p>The <code>render</code> function—a Django “shortcut” (a combination of multiple built-ins for convenience)—takes the existing request object, looks for the template <code>myapp/year.html</code> in the list of available template locations, and passes the dictionary data to it as <em>context</em> for the template. The template uses the dictionary as a namespace for variables used in the template. In this case, the variable <code>{{year}}</code> in the template is replaced with the value for the key year in the dictionary data (that is, <code>data["year"]</code>).</p>



<p>The amount of processing you can do on data within Django templates is intentionally limited. Django’s philosophy is to enforce the separation of presentation and business logic whenever possible. Thus, you can loop through an iterable object, and you can perform if/then/else tests, but modifying the data within a template is discouraged.</p>



<p>For instance, you could encode a simple “if” test this way:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>
{% if year > 2000 %}
21st century year: {{year}}
{% else %}
Pre-21st century year: {{year}}
{% endif %}
</code></pre>



<p>The <code>{%</code> and <code>%}</code> markers delimit blocks of code that can be executed in Django’s template language.</p>



<p>If you want to use a more sophisticated template processing language, you can swap in something like Jinja2 or Mako. Django includes back-end integration for Jinja2, but you can use any template language that returns a string—for instance, by returning that string in an <code>HttpResponse</code> object, as in the case of our “Hello, world!” route.</p>



<p>In versions 6 and up, Django supports template partials, a way to create portions of a template that can be defined once and reused throughout a template. This lets you precompute a given value once over the course of a given template—such as a fancy display version of a user name—and re-use it without having to recompute it each time it’s displayed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="doing-more-with-django">Doing more with Django</h3>



<p>What you’ve seen here covers only the most basic elements of a Django application. Django includes a great many other components for use in web projects. Here’s a quick overview:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Databases and data models</strong>: Django’s built-in ORM lets you define data structures and relationships between them, as well as migration paths between versions of those structures.</li>



<li><strong>Forms</strong>: Django provides a consistent way for views to supply input forms to a user, retrieve data, normalize the results, and provide consistent error reporting. Django 6 added support for Content Security Policy, a way to prevent submitted forms from being vulnerable to content injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Security and utilities</strong>: Django includes many built-in functions for caching, logging, session handling, handling static files, and normalizing URLs. It also bundles tools for common security needs like using cryptographic certificates or guarding against cross-site forgery protection or clickjacking.</li>



<li><strong>Tasks</strong>: Django 6 added a native mechanisms for creating and managing long-running background tasks, without holding up a response to the user. Note that Django only provides ways to set up and keep track of tasks; it doesn’t include the actual execution mechanism. The only included back ends for tasks are for testing, so you will either need to add a third-party solution or write your own using Django’s back-end task code as a base.</li>
</ul>
