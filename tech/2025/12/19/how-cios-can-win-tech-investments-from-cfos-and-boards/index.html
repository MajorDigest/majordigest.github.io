<p>When I transitioned from the CFO’s desk to a leadership coach and as a director on corporate boards, I observed a truth: that securing approval for technology investment isn’t just an IT conversation. But it’s a business conversation.</p>



<p>It’s about trust, alignment, language and, most importantly, shared purpose. For every CIO reading this article, note that the money you seek is not simply a line item in a budget, but it’s the future your business is seeking to build. Getting it backed by your finance team and endorsed by the Board will enable smooth implementation for you as the CIO. Here’s how you can go about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="understand-your-cfos-perspective">Understand your CFO’s perspective</h3>



<p>Early in my corporate career, I remember a tech leader walking into my office with a slide deck full of diagrams and acronyms. I didn’t reject the idea because it lacked merit, but because I couldn’t see the business outcome.</p>



<p>As CFO, what I cared about were three things, which were the return on investment, risk management and cash impact. If the technology didn’t speak those languages, it would struggle for approval.</p>



<p>According to research, the companies where the CIO-CFO relationship is strong are far more likely to secure digital funding.</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> Before submitting your request, ask: how does this project help shape the margin, growth, cost avoidance or lead to increased productivity? Include a cost-benefit analysis if required. Let the financial pulse of the company be at the centre of your case.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="align-the-tech-initiative-with-business-strategy">Align the tech initiative with business strategy</h3>



<p>As a Board Director, I often ask: “How does this tech initiative support our strategic objective?” Whether it was entering a new market, improving customer experience or managing a cost base, if the technology didn’t map to one of those, the Board would push back.  </p>



<p>As highlighted in industry research, the shift from IT function to enterprise strategy means the CIO and CFO must operate almost as co-pilots on the business growth journey.</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> Create a clear line of sight between the initiative and your company’s strategic growth plan. Highlight with phrases such as “supports strategic priority A,” “enables 10% faster time-to-market,” “reduces cost by X%.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="build-a-compelling-business-case">Build a compelling business case</h3>



<p>In one of my Board roles, the tech leader, I recall, had a clear ask. He presented the Board with a clear timeline, with an ROI and the payback period. It got approved. I’ve since coached CIOs to think in those terms: the ask must be frameable in financial language, such as total cost of ownership (TCO), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, etc., not just technical merit.</p>



<p>According to TechTarget, CIOs working under CFO oversight need business cases that translate into straightforward financial justification.</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> For each major cost you identify, show the offsetting benefit (reduced cost, new revenue, risk mitigation, etc.). Include scenario modelling (base case, optimistic case). Commit to tracking outcomes. If required, educate Board members on the impact of the proposed tech initiative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="address-risk-mitigation-and-compliance">Address risk mitigation and compliance</h3>



<p>During my tenure as CFO, I learned early that even the most promising tech initiative could stall if the risk side was invisible. Whether it’s regulatory exposure, cybersecurity vulnerability, legacy-system complexity or integration failures, the Board and finance leadership want to see that you’ve “thought about what can go wrong” as much as “what good will come.”</p>



<p>I recall receiving an impersonating email from my CEO seeking urgent transfer of funds when he was away on vacation. I realized it was fishy and got the tech team to check on its source and fix the future risks. Remember that the cost of non-compliance is always higher than the cost of compliance. Better safe than sorry.</p>



<p>A recent study emphasises that IT investments require consistent governance and value measurement to assure the CFO that the initiative isn’t a black box of cost and uncertainty.</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> In your presentation or business case, include a dedicated section titled “Risk &amp; Mitigation.” Outline the major threats (for example: vendor lock-in, data quality gaps, regulatory change, legacy compatibility, etc.) and map each to a control or plan. Explain how you’ll manage governance, pilot phase, KPIs, etc. Demonstrating governance and transparency converts technology ambition into a credible business investment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="communicate-in-a-language-they-understand">Communicate in a language they understand</h3>



<p>I’ve seen tech leaders lose the CFO or Board audience by using IT jargon. Remember, they are not IT experts and may not be familiar with the IT terms. One Board member summarized it well: “Tell me what it does for the business, not just how you’ll build it.”</p>



<p>As one guide on executive-level selling points out, “Selling to the C-suite requires shifting from tactical to strategic language but focusing on business outcomes, not features.”</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> Practice your presentation with a finance colleague. Replace geek-speak with business outcomes. Use visuals that show the benefits of tech and the outcomes. Speak on growth, speed, risk, cost and not just features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="use-real-life-examples-and-success-stories">Use real-life examples and success stories</h3>



<p>In my Board role, when I heard a CIO reference successful deployments at peer companies, it built confidence and momentum. Because people believe in success stories more than mere statements. Polish your communication and storytelling skills.</p>



<p>In the broader research, it’s clear that resolving conflicts between CIOs and CFOs often comes through demonstrating tangible results and building trust incrementally.</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> Include a section in your article/request: “Proof-points”. Show internal wins (if any), even small ones. Or external industry benchmarks. Share data such as “Reduced downtime from X to Y,” “Pilot delivered 5% cost saving.” Then link it to the larger roll-out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="foster-a-collaborative-approach">Foster a collaborative approach</h3>



<p>My transition from CFO to independent director reinforced one thing: tech leaders who view the CFO and Board as adversaries lose before they begin. The high-performing partnerships I saw treated the CFO as a co-owner of the strategy, not an obstacle.</p>



<p>Gartner found that when CIO and CFO collaborate closely, organizations are much more likely to find funding and meet business outcomes.</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> Set up a joint governance forum (CIO + CFO + business leaders). Invite and involve the CFO in your tech roadmap discussions. Ask how you can help you with financial visibility, or what metrics they are tracking. Frame yourself as an ally, not just a spender, to get the buy-in from your CFO.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="prepare-for-the-future">Prepare for the future</h3>



<p>Having served as CFO and now as a Board director, one thing is crystal clear: the investments you bring to the table today can either lock you into yesterday’s world or position your organization for tomorrow’s. As a CIO, when you come to finance or the Board with a technology ask, it’s not enough to show “what this project solves now”. You must show “where this project leads us” and showcase the destination of capability, scalability and strategic advantage.</p>



<p>A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group found that many technology investments stall not because they lack potential, but because they don’t integrate into a longer-term roadmap or sequence of value. In other words, you need to articulate how this investment serves today and primes the business for the next wave of change.</p>



<p>Whether it’s AI, cloud scalability, ESG reporting or digital ecosystems, your ask should reflect readiness for tomorrow. Are we future-ready? What actions will make us future-ready? How can we educate our people and integrate AI into our business?</p>



<p><strong>Action:</strong> In your proposal, include what each phase will bring about. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Phase 1: Deliver core outcome</li>



<li>Phase 2: Scale/expand</li>



<li>Phase 3: Future-mode</li>
</ul>



<p>Show how this investment creates optionality; your business is not just solving today’s problem but positioning for the next wave. By mapping out the journey, you reassure the CFO and Board that you’re not just spending, but you’re investing. You’re not just solving a problem, but you’re building a capability that serves the future. And that’s how technology funding shifts from one-off to strategic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together</h3>



<p>If you started this article as a transaction like “I need funding for project X”, shift your mindset to a partnership: “Here’s how we together will drive business growth, manage risk and position the company for the future.”</p>



<p>I’ve been on the finance side. I’ve sat in the boardroom listening to the voices that approve or veto. I know what makes them lean in and what makes them pause. For you, the CIO, this isn’t just about technology. It’s about business momentum, credibility, trust and shared language.</p>



<p>So before you walk into that boardroom or finance review, rehearse your message for the CFO and the Board audience. Use business language. Embed financial metrics. Build governance and risk clarity. Show you’re working with them, not against. And finally, tell a story. One that begins with the business opportunity, weaves through the tech solution and ends with measurable value.</p>



<p>That’s when technology funding moves from permission to partnership. And that’s when you, as CIO, step into the role of a true strategic business enabler.</p>
