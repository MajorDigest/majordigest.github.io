<figure><figcaption><p>At the African Burial Ground National Monument, visitors on Dec. 26 can take part in Kwanzaa festivities and learn more about the holiday. According to the National Park Service, Kwanzaa is an annual, non-religious cultural holiday that takes place from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1. Established in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, the seven-day celebration of Black culture, history and community draws on African harvest festival traditions, promoting unity and self-determination and connecting people of African descent with their heritage. The name originates from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza, meaning &#8220;first fruits.&#8221; (Photo credit: NPS)</p>

<figure><figcaption><p>U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Bill White met with Jewish leaders in Brussels to celebrate the Jewish Festival of Lights. &#8220;My husband Bryan Eure and I marked Hanukkah in Brussels by celebrating light, resilience, and hope at the Great Synagogue. Even more so after the antisemitic terror attack in Sydney, we stand in solidarity with Jewish communities in Belgium and around the world. We must work together to confront and eliminate antisemitism decisively and collectively,&#8221; White posted on X.</p>
