    <p>Self-driving cars merged onto Bay Area freeways, artificial intelligence reshaped classrooms and offices, and political battles over housing, immigration and public safety spilled into daily life in 2025.</p>
<p>Rather than a single defining moment, a series of technological, political and cultural shifts quietly altered how the region lives, works and governs itself.</p>
<p>Those changes drove major Bay Area stories with far-reaching consequences for the region’s economy, residents and culture — and in some cases, the world.</p>
<p>Here are the top Bay Area stories of 2025:</p>


<p>In October, Nvidia, a Santa Clara-based company founded around a Denny&#8217;s table in East San Jose in 1993, became the first company in history to reach a market value of $5 trillion.</p>

<p>CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang, who immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Taiwan and worked as a dishwasher and busboy before earning electrical engineering degrees from Oregon State and Stanford, saw his net worth soar to an estimated $152 billion, making him the world&#8217;s eighth-richest person, according to Forbes.</p>
<p>The reason for Nvidia’s dominance was simple: It makes the chips powering artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>AI was everywhere in 2025 — and the Bay Area was its epicenter. The technology increasingly shaped how people worked, learned, traveled and entertained themselves.</p>
<p>Students routinely used ChatGPT and other AI tools to help with homework or draft entire papers. Self-driving cars navigated city streets and freeways. AI helped detect cancer, improved weather forecasting, powered video games, and shaped what people watched on Netflix or bought on Amazon.</p>
<p>The boom lifted Bay Area tech giants, including Google, Meta and AMD, fueling hiring, pushing up housing demand, and accelerating the construction of energy-hungry data centers.</p>
<p>But it also sparked deep unease: copyright battles, deepfake misinformation, fears of mass job displacement and warnings of a speculative bubble — even science-fiction scenarios in which AI systems could one day be weaponized.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the single most impactful technology of our time,&#8221; Huang told Time magazine.</p>
<p>After 2025, few argued otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>2) Newsom for president?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>After nearly seven years as governor, former San Francisco mayor and current Marin County resident Gavin Newsom emerged in 2025 as one of Democrats’ most aggressive national figures — largely by positioning himself as President Donald Trump’s chief antagonist.</p>
<p>When Trump returned to office, California sued his administration 50 times. Newsom pushed back against immigration raids, environmental rollbacks and<strong> </strong>tariffs. When Trump pressured Texas to redraw congressional districts to benefit Republicans, Newsom responded by placing Proposition 50 on California’s ballot, expanding Democratic-leaning districts. Voters approved it in a landslide.</p>
<p>Newsom mocked Trump relentlessly on social media, often using the president’s own confrontational style.</p>
<p>It remains early in the 2028 presidential cycle, and Newsom carries vulnerabilities, from homelessness to California’s high cost of living.</p>
<p>Still, with one year left as governor, his approval rating rose to 55% in a December PPIC poll, up 10 points from a year earlier. Nationally, the Real Clear Politics polling average from August to December shows him leading potential Democratic rivals, including Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and JB Pritzker.</p>
<p>Newsom has deep-pocketed donors in Hollywood and Silicon Valley. He is energetic, media-savvy and, for many Democrats, willing to go on offense.</p>
<p>Whether that translates into a winning national campaign remains an open question.</p>

<p><strong>3) ICE raids<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown roiled Bay Area communities in 2025.</p>
<p>Federal agents — many wearing masks — arrested people at workplaces, courthouses, and near churches and schools. Statewide, thousands were deported: some convicted criminals, others longtime residents who had been brought to the U.S. as children or were working low-wage jobs. In some cases, American citizens were wrongfully detained.</p>
<p>Trump also sent Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops to cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, and planned similar deployments to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>That changed Oct. 23, after San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and several tech executives urged Trump to stand down.</p>
<p>“I got a great call from some incredible people, some friends of mine, very successful people,” Trump told reporters, citing Huang, Nvidia&#8217;s CEO, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.</p>
<p>The reversal likely avoided violent clashes between activists and federal authorities. But Bay Area leaders — including Newsom, who secured a court ruling ordering the National Guard out of Los Angeles — warned that tensions would remain high into 2026.</p>

<p><strong>4) Golden State Valkyries’ breakout first season<br />
</strong></p>
<p>On May 16, more than 18,000 fans packed Chase Center in San Francisco — not to watch the Warriors, but to cheer the Golden State Valkyries.</p>
<p>The WNBA expansion franchise became the league’s first new team in 17 years, and the Bay Area embraced it immediately.</p>
<p>The Valkyries sold out all 22 home games, set attendance records and became the only expansion team in league history to reach the playoffs in its inaugural season.</p>
<p>Head coach Natalie Nakase was named WNBA Coach of the Year. Guard Veronica Burton won Most Improved Player honors.</p>
<p>In 2026, the team — owned by Warriors executives Joe Lacob and Peter Guber — will face roster decisions and expectations that come with success. But its debut underscored the Bay Area’s appetite for women’s professional sports.</p>
<p>“That was crazy. Like, you felt it, you know?&#8221; forward Janelle Salaün after the season finale. &#8220;We felt the energy.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>5) Beloved East Bay football coach John Beam killed<br />
</strong></p>
<p>In the 1946 classic &#8220;It’s a Wonderful Life,&#8221; Clarence the angel tells George Bailey that each life leaves “an awful hole” when it’s gone.</p>
<p>Few embodied that truth more than John Beam.</p>
<p>As head football coach at Skyline High School in Oakland from 1987 to 2003, Beam mentored hundreds of young men, many from disadvantaged backgrounds. He compiled a 160-33 record before moving to Laney College, where he continued shaping lives on and off the field.</p>
<p>Under his guidance, more than 100 players went on to Division I football. Nearly all graduated or transferred to four-year schools. Several reached the NFL. In 2019, his program was featured on Netflix’s &#8220;Last Chance U.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beam was shot at Laney College on Nov. 13, where he had been serving as athletic director. Cedric Irving Jr., a former player, was charged with murder. The motive remains unclear.</p>
<p>Hundreds attended his memorial service Dec. 10.</p>
<p>&#8220;For 45 years, he showed up when others stepped back,&#8221; Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said. &#8220;He believed in our young people before they believed in themselves.&#8221;</p>


<p>On Nov. 6, Nancy Pelosi announced she would not seek reelection, ending a political era in San Francisco and Washington.</p>
<p>First elected in 1987, Pelosi became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the U.S. House, wielding extraordinary influence during narrow Democratic majorities. She helped shepherd landmark legislation, including the Affordable Care Act, and led two impeachments of Trump.</p>
<p>Her departure triggered a high-profile race to succeed her, with candidates including state Sen. Scott Wiener, Supervisor Connie Chan and former tech executive Saikat Chakrabarti.</p>
<p>Pelosi endorsed House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries as her successor, positioning the party for a generational transition.</p>

<p><strong>7) VTA strike shuts down the South Bay<br />
</strong><br />
On March 10, more than 100,000 Silicon Valley residents woke up without buses or light rail. Valley Transportation Agency workers launched the agency’s longest strike, demanding an 18% raise over three years amid soaring housing costs. The agency countered with a 9% raise, noting that ridership had not recovered since COVID-19 and that its operators were already the fifth-highest paid in the nation.</p>
<p>After 17 days, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge ordered the union&#8217;s 1,500 employees back to work. A new contract approved in June included raises totaling 14.5% over four years and improved benefits.</p>
<p>As remote work continues to depress ridership, transit agencies are now weighing service cuts or a potential sales tax increase — a debate likely to define Bay Area transportation politics in 2026.</p>

<p><strong>8) Housing and homelessness reforms<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Facing voter anger over encampments and housing costs, Bay Area leaders took bolder — and sometimes controversial — steps in 2025.</p>
<p>State lawmakers Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Buffy Wicks of Oakland passed measures overriding local zoning rules to accelerate apartment construction near transit. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan pivoted toward rapid-build interim housing, doubling shelter capacity by adding more than 1,100 beds.</p>
<p>The approach marked a shift from a strict “Housing First” philosophy and included tougher enforcement, including clearing encampments and penalizing repeated shelter refusals.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s humane or compassionate to allow people to live and die on our streets,” Mahan said.</p>
<p>The strategy, praised by some and criticized by others, elevated Mahan’s profile statewide — and signaled a broader recalibration among Democratic leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9) Driverless cars hit Bay Area freeways<br />
</strong><br />
That car next to you on the freeway may not have a driver.</p>
<p>On Nov. 12, Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet Inc., announced its autonomous vehicles would begin offering freeway rides across the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Phoenix — a first in the U.S.</p>
<p>The driverless taxi race now includes Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox, in a market analysts say could be worth tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Skepticism remains. A Waymo vehicle killed a cat in San Francisco’s Mission District in October, drawing public outrage. Supporters counter that autonomous cars do not drive drunk, fall asleep or text — and that human drivers kill about 40,000 people annually.</p>
<p>The companies are beginning to offer service to airports and to teens as young as 14 who can use them to get to school. In 2026, Waymo plans to expand to more than a dozen other American cities. &#8220;Running on empty&#8221; is about to take on a whole new meaning.</p>


<p>In February, 15-year-old David Gutierrez was stabbed to death at Santana Row in San Jose while on a Valentine’s Day date. Police said attackers mistook him for a rival gang member.</p>
<p>Nine months later, on Black Friday, a shooting at Westfield Valley Fair in Santa Clara injured three people and sent thousands fleeing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors charged a 17-year-old suspect with attempted murder, seeking adult court penalties that could bring decades in prison. Police said the teen was wearing red and encountered others wearing blue, a color associated with a rival gang.</p>
<p>San Jose Mayor Mahan and other local leaders called for tougher sentencing for gang crime — reigniting a statewide debate over juvenile justice, public safety and political risk in a year that left many Bay Area residents on edge.</p>
