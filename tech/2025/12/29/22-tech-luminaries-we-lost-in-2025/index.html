<p>As modern technologies such as artificial intelligence grab today’s headlines, it’s worth remembering that their foundations were being laid more than half a century ago by computer scientists, philosophers, psychologists, developers, entrepreneurs, and more. These pioneers and those who followed tackled issues and solved problems that future generations may never know existed — but without their seminal work, we wouldn’t be where we are today.</p>



<p>As we look back on 2025, Computerworld honors the lives of those we lost, including our own beloved colleague Lucas Mearian. Here are 22 tech trailblazers whose accomplishments helped shape our world.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="steve-langasek-debian-devotee">Steve Langasek: Debian devotee</h3>



<p><strong>April 27, 1979 – January 1, 2025</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p>After experimenting with Slackware and Red Hat as a teenager, Steve Langasek began contributing to Debian Linux at 21 — then dedicated the rest of his life to open-source software. He eventually rose to principal engineer, volunteer release manager for Debian, Ubuntu release manager for Canonical, and maintainer or co-maintainer of packages such as samba, pam, and openldap2.3 — all while serving as a respected Linux leader, organizer, and mentor.</p>



<p>“Steve shone with a clarity of purpose that motivated many others to build the very best open source platforms they could dream about,” wrote Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth. “He touched thousands of people’s lives directly, and his work improves the lives of millions.”</p>



<p>Langasek was 45 when he passed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mike-maples-sr-the-adult-in-the-room">Mike Maples Sr.: The adult in the room</h3>



<p><strong>August 25, 1942 – January 9, 2025</strong></p>

<p>In 1988, Microsoft hired Mike Maples Sr., a decades-long veteran of IBM, to serve as the executive vice president of the Worldwide Products Group. Microsoft “was just a bunch of kids struggling to figure out how to do things,” said Maples, who, at 46, was more than a decade older than co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Maples restructured Microsoft so it could evolve from startup to enterprise, and he raised the bar for quality assurance and customer commitments, reducing defects and release delays for products as vital as Windows and Microsoft Office.</p>



<p>Maples headed the products group at Microsoft until his retirement in 1995. He was 82 when he died.</p>

<p>Logic programming dates to the 1970s with Prolog and Datalog, languages that presented radically different approaches to programming. Still used today in applications such as big data processing, these languages, as well as modern, inference-based AI systems, were made possible by Dr. Cordell Green, who established the theoretical basis for the field of logic programming. His work earned him the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1985.</p>



<p>Green also worked at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), where he assisted those who were creating ARPANET, the precursor to the internet. And in 1981, Green founded the Kestrel Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to software program synthesis, refinement, analysis, and verification. He died at 83.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="rod-burstall-ai-educator">Rod Burstall: AI educator</h3>



<p><strong>November 11, 1934 – February 13, 2025</strong></p>



<p>Rod Burstall’s career at the University of Edinburgh spanned from 1964 to his retirement in 2000. In the late 1960s, he contributed to the creation of programming languages COWSEL and POP-2, which persisted for decades and were used to teach early AI programming to college students in the 1980s. And in 1987, Burstall and three colleagues founded the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS), a collaborative community of scientists exploring the analysis and design of computing systems. The lab exists to this day, having researched such fields as blockchain technology, quantum computing, and secure voting models. Burstall was 90 when he passed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ronald-a-katz-inventing-connections">Ronald A. Katz: Inventing connections</h3>



<p><strong>March 10, 1936 – March 28, 2025</strong></p>

<p>Ronald Katz began innovating in the phone industry at the age of 25, when he co-founded Telecredit, a company that provided vendors with automated phone verification of personal checks. A prolific inventor, Katz held more than 50 US patents involving phone-routing systems, speech recognition, video monitoring, and more. Call centers that relied on his inventions included those of IBM, Microsoft, AT&T, HP, and Citibank.</p>



<p>Katz used his fortune to fund the establishment of the Ronald A. Katz Center for Collaborative Military Medicine at UCLA and UCLA Health Operation Mend, supporting the physical and mental health needs of veterans; and UCLA’s 3 Wishes Project, helping end-of-life patients achieve their final wishes. He died at 89.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="david-tht-battling-bufferbloat">David Täht: Battling bufferbloat</h3>



<p><strong>August 11, 1965 – April 1, 2025</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper youtube-video">

</div></figure>



<p>If you’ve ever streamed a movie, hopped on a video call, or played an online game, you can thank Dave Täht — CEO of TekLibre and chief science officer at LibreQoS — for that seamless experience. Täht tackled the issue of network latency by zeroing in on “bufferbloat,” the tendency of internet routers to buffer too much data, resulting in lag. With Jim Gettys, he co-founded the Bufferbloat Project to address this flaw at the software level, leading to improvements across many Linux distributions powering today’s routers. The beneficiaries of his work range from consumers to corporations such as Netflix and Microsoft. Täht was 59 when he died.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="lee-yong-tae-koreas-pc-pioneer">Lee Yong-tae: Korea’s PC pioneer</h3>



<p><strong>August 18, 1932 – April 14, 2025</strong></p>



<p>In the 1970s, while the United States was adopting computers that used the Roman alphabet, Lee Yong-tae was developing the first terminals to accept Hangul, the Korean alphabet. In 1980 he founded Sambo Computers, Korea’s first dedicated computer company, which released the first Korean-made PC in 1981; an Apple II clone in 1982; a PC-compatible in 1984; and, in 1989, a laptop that supported MS-DOS, Mac OS, and Unix. By 1990, Sambo also controlled 80% of the country’s printer market, and it proceeded to manufacture millions of laptops a year and to provide broadband internet access through its ISP, Dru-net.</p>



<p>After facing stiff competition in the 2000s, the company was broken up in 2010, with some assets now managed by Lee’s son. The founder died at 92.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="david-cope-music-modeler">David Cope: Music modeler</h3>



<p><strong>May 17, 1941 – May 4, 2025</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper youtube-video">

</div></figure>



<p>In 1981, UC Santa Cruz music professor David Cope found himself creatively blocked and unable to compose an opera he’d been commissioned to write. So he instead developed software  to write the music for him. The result was EMI, or Experiments in Musical Intelligence, a program that could ingest an artist’s work and then create a new score in the same style. Cope used EMI to create new works in the style of Mozart, Brahms, and other classical greats, with results so stylistically similar to those of the original artists that even trained listeners couldn’t tell the difference. AI-generated music is practically a parlor trick today, but 40 years ago, Cope’s work was an unprecedented crescendo. He was 83 when he passed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gail-wellington-herding-cats">Gail Wellington: Herding CATS </h3>



<p><strong>January 14, 1940 – May 14, 2025</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper youtube-video">

</div></figure>



<p>The Commodore PET was one of three computers that launched the personal computing revolution in 1977. In 1981 Commodore hired Gail Wellington, who had a degree in tech writing, to produce user manuals for third-party software that ran on the PET. She rose through the company’s ranks to become head of software operations and later worldwide Amiga product manager. She oversaw the 1985 launch of the Amiga computer, the 1987 formation of the Commodore Applications and Technical Support (CATS) group, and the development of the Commodore Dynamic Total Vision (CDTV), a home entertainment and gaming console that was released in 1991 but was a commercial flop. </p>



<p>Commodore declared bankruptcy in 1994, but not before redefining the home computing landscape — and modern versions of its hardware are still available. Wellington was 85 when she died.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="peter-lax-explosive-equations">Peter Lax: Explosive equations</h3>



<p><strong>May 1, 1926 – May 16, 2025</strong></p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>Peter Lax in 1969</p>

<p>Hungarian mathematician Peter Lax was a child prodigy who, at the age of 19, worked on the Manhattan Project, calculating shockwaves from nuclear bombs. After the war, Lax earned his PhD and joined the faculty at NYU but continued to work for Los Alamos and the US Atomic Energy Commission. </p>



<p>While he was best known for his mathematical breakthroughs in the field of hyperbolic partial differential equations, for which he was awarded the prestigious Abel Prize in 2005, he had a profound impact on information technology through his early and ongoing application of supercomputers to a variety of mathematical problems. Throughout his career, Lax used computers to analyze complex data, effectively demonstrating the value of computers in science and engineering and laying the groundwork for their use across a wide variety of disciplines today. He was 99 when he passed.</p>

<p>Computer scientist Jean-Raymond Abrial developed Z notation — not a programming language, but a series of mathematical rules and specifications for how a computing system should operate. He later created B method — a way to define and refine mathematical models that ultimately results in software development.

<p>In 1969, George E. Smith and his Bell Laboratories colleague Willard S. Boyle developed the charge-coupled device (CCD), an integrated circuit the size of a dime that converts photons to electrons. Bell used the CCD to showcase a video telephone at the 1964 World’s Fair — decades before Zoom or FaceTime. </p>



<p>But the CCD was no mere novelty: it became the basis for digital photography and is used in millions of modern devices, from smartphones to x-rays to the Hubble Space Telescope. The global impact of this small invention earned Smith and Boyle the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. Smith was 95.</p>

<p>Bill Atkinson joined Apple Computer as employee #51 at the age of 27. He designed and developed both a graphical user interface (GUI) and its underlying technology, LisaGraf (later QuickDraw), for the Apple Lisa — a commercial flop, but also a proving ground for nascent technologies for Apple’s next product. Atkinson then became one of the founding members of the team developing the Macintosh, the success of which was in large part owed to its intuitive GUI. </p>



<p>Atkinson also developed MacPaint, which shipped with the Mac, and HyperCard, a hypermedia database program, which Sir Tim Berners-Lee cited as an inspiration in his original proposal for what became the World Wide Web. Without Atkinson, neither Apple nor the Web would be what they are today. He was 74 when he passed.</p>

<p>New Zealand-born Barry Vercoe joined MIT in 1971, where he spent the next five decades researching, developing, and teaching digital audio analysis and processing. In 1984, he became a founding member of the MIT Media Lab, where he developed Csound, an open-source programming language for audio programming. Csound is still used by computer music composers today, and it powers the audio aspects of the One Laptop Per Child project. Structured Audio Orchestra Language (SAOL), derived from Csound, is a key component of the MPEG-4 compression codec used in almost all modern audio and video formats. Vercoe passed at age 87.</p>

<p>While at the United Kingdom’s National Physical Laboratory in the 1940s, Alan Turning designed the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) computer. When he left in 1947, it fell to Mike Woodger and his team to complete the project, which culminated in a scaled-down prototype in 1950. The Pilot ACE, one of the UK’s first computers, was so practical that a full-fledged ACE was never built; instead, the Pilot ACE was adapted for commercial use under the name DEUCE. </p>



<p>Woodger later contributed to the development of the programming languages ALGOL 60 and Ada. The latter was commissioned by the US Department of Defense to replace over four hundred different programming languages then in use across the DoD; the department still uses Ada today. Woodger was 102.</p>

<p>As a philosopher and cognitive scientist, Margaret Boden dedicated her life to studying artificial intelligence. She theorized not only what AI could and could not be capable of (such as various kinds of creativity), but also how it could serve as a model for the human condition and thought processes. </p>



<p>In 2010, Boden contributed to “Principles of Robotics,” an influential paper proposing five rules for responsible robotics development, such as “the illusion of emotions and intent should not be used to exploit vulnerable users” and “robots should be designed and operated to comply with existing law, including privacy.” These standards became the basis for UNESCO’s official recommendations for laws to govern our growing use of AI tools such as large language models — tools that Boden herself predicted but never experienced firsthand, as she was already in a care home by the time LLMs emerged. Boden was 88 when she passed.</p>

<p>Gilles Dowek was a researcher at the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria), a French computer science and applied mathematics research institute. There, he observed that Inria’s different teams were siloed, using different organizational methods and proof systems to conduct their research. Dowek set out to unify these formal logic systems to improve communication and discoverability between teams. His later work focused on programming languages for quantum computers and logic as a field of thought.</p>



<p>Dowek was also a tireless human rights advocate who chaired the Association for the Recognition of the Rights of Homosexual and Trans People to Immigration and Residence (Ardhis), ensuring that French citizens and nationals, at home or abroad, have the right to residence and asylum.

<p>H. Ross Perot may have revolutionized IT outsourcing when he founded Electronic Data Systems (EDS), but Morton Meyerson was the brains of the operation. Hired in 1966 as EDS’s 54<sup>th</sup> employee, Meyerson swiftly secured the company a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. Meyerson used this opportunity to implement a business model that became known as IT outsourcing, leading EDS’s profit to increase a hundredfold in just two years. Meyerson eventually became the president of EDS, remaining in the role even after General Motors bought EDS for $2.5 billion in 1984.</p>



<p>He later founded a family investment firm, 2M Companies, and a philanthropic nonprofit, Morton H. Meyerson Family Foundation. He was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in 2013. Meyerson died at age 87.</p>

<p>Born in Germany to a Jewish family in 1933, Stephanie Shirley escaped to the United Kingdom, where she became a gifted and determined mathematician and computer scientist. After being subjected to the sexism that was rampant in a male-dominated industry, Shirley set out to ensure a different experience for those who followed. She founded Freelance Programmers, an outsourcing company that hired women, especially mothers, almost exclusively. Contracts came more easily when she signed her name “Steve,” and Freelance Programmers eventually grew into Xansa, a multi-billion-dollar company whose projects included the Concorde airplane’s “black box” flight recorder. </p>

<p>Trained as a psychiatrist, Warren Brodey nonetheless focused on cybernetics and artificial intelligence throughout his life. Starting in 1965, he spent most of his career at MIT, where he worked alongside famed AI researcher Marvin Minsky. Whereas Minsky advocated for AI based on large quantities of existing data, thus reinforcing existing norms, Brodey campaigned for AI that, by being creative and revolutionary, would rethink and enhance humanity. </p>



<p>Brodey co-founded two labs, the Environmental Ecology Lab and later Ecology Tool and Toy, where he further explored materials and environments that responded to and improved human behavior — concepts he still believed possible, even with the rise of modern AI that followed Minsky’s model.
