<p>During his decade of service at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Rodney Petersen has had a front-row seat to the evolving state of the cyber workforce across government, industry and academia.</p>
<p>In his role as director of education and workforce at NIST’s Applied Cybersecurity Division, Petersen led efforts to standardize cyber workforce job descriptions and better understand skills gaps that are now a recurring theme in cyber policy discussions.</p>
<p>He served as second director of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, which is now just known as its acronym, “NICE.” NIST’s “NICE Framework” is now an internationally accepted taxonomy to describe professional cyber roles, as well as the knowledge and skills needed to work in the fast-evolving field.</p>
<p>Those efforts have been foundational as the national cyber workforce evolved into a pressing issue at the highest levels of government. </p>
<p>“One of the biggest changes in my 11 years here has just been the proliferation and the growth and expansion of education and workforce efforts,” Petersen said. “And so that&#8217;s mostly a good thing, because it shows that we&#8217;re prioritizing and putting investments in place to both increase the supply and also find the demand. But at the same time, it makes NICE’s mission all the more important to make sure we&#8217;re creating a coordinated approach across the U.S.”</p>
<p>Petersen is set to retire from his post at the end of the year. He recently sat down with Federal News Network to discuss his career at NIST, the evolution of cyber workforce initiatives over the last 10 years, and the future of the cybersecurity career field amid the rise of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><em>(This interview transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity).</em></p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday</strong> What led you to where you are, to NIST and to the NICE program, in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>Since NICE works so much on cybersecurity careers, you have to remind people that it&#8217;s not always linear, or maybe you don&#8217;t end up where you expect it to be, and that&#8217;s certainly been true of me.</p>
<p>In undergraduate and through law school, I certainly expected to be in a legal career. I got quickly introduced to higher education and education policy. So my first job out of law school was actually at Michigan State University and then subsequently University of Maryland. So that was maybe my first pivot to move into academia, but continuing to use the law and policy expertise. And then back in the mid ‘90s, there was something called the world wide web and the internet that started hitting college campuses, and I began to combine my legal policy expertise with the growing field of information technology and work for the first CIO and vice president of information technology at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p>And that eventually led me to cybersecurity, where, once again, it was an emerging field and topic. Not a lot of history, certainly within colleges and universities, of having personnel doing that work. The Association of Colleges and Universities that focused on it was EDUCAUSE, and they brought me in to establish their first program in cybersecurity and eventually the Higher Education Information Security Council. Then maybe my final pivot from there was to NIST, which was a position in the federal government, but not just focusing on cybersecurity from an operational or an IT perspective but from an education and workforce perspective. So again, I appreciated the opportunity to pivot and continue to work on another dimension of cybersecurity, which was: Now, how do we create the next generation of cybersecurity workers that the nation needs?</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>As you reflect on that last decade, what were some of the biggest challenges or successes, just things that immediately pop up into your mind as, ‘Wow, it&#8217;s 2025. I can&#8217;t believe we worked through that just five or 10 years ago?’</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen</strong> I didn&#8217;t say what really attracted me to the government was NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, not only because it&#8217;s a standards organization, but it&#8217;s widely respected among industry and in my case academia, for providing some common standards, guidelines, best practices for cybersecurity. I really didn&#8217;t know a lot about the NICE program, certainly not the NICE framework, which I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk more about in a moment, but that provided a similar kind of common taxonomy and lexicon.</p>
<p>Now, when I say I didn&#8217;t know much about NICE framework, it&#8217;s a little misleading, because I was involved in some of the early days when DHS was trying to create a common body of knowledge for cybersecurity, and both a combination of that work and then the work I was doing with EDUCAUSE across higher education, you know, 4000-plus colleges and universities in the United States. We were trying to find some common ground and do things that could lead to shared services or shared approaches and the like. NIST was a great place to bring that all together.</p>
<p>The NICE framework specifically evolved over the years starting from common body of knowledge, the CIO Council recognizing the need, from an employer&#8217;s perspective, to have some commonality across the cybersecurity workforce. NIST began working with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, culminating in the 2017 NIST special publication for the first time with the NICE framework. And then fast forwarding to today, where we work increasingly with private sector employers as well as academia to really create some common vision, common strategy and a mission that really teaches us to integrate approaches across the various ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>How challenging has that been in terms of getting to this widespread adoption of the NICE framework. I&#8217;m sure you measure that in different ways at NIST. How far have we come in terms of that standardization and how far do we still have to go?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>If you&#8217;re an organization or a sector who&#8217;s starting from ground zero, and if you discover the NICE framework or the NIST cybersecurity framework or any other similar guidance document, you&#8217;re in a perfect situation to adopt it wholesale, because you haven&#8217;t started anything else, or you don&#8217;t have to retrofit something else. And there are certainly examples, in fact, internationally, where other countries start to get into the cybersecurity workforce space, and they discover the NICE framework. It really gives them a starting place, a jump start to building their own unique framework that meets their needs.</p>
<p>Where it&#8217;s more challenging is where there&#8217;s existing work and efforts that you either have to retrofit or try to modify or adjust. An example for that is we work closely with the NSA and CISA and the National Centers of Academic Excellence and Cybersecurity. They provide designations to colleges and universities that meet their guidelines for what a cybersecurity education program should look like, and it&#8217;s based upon what they call knowledge units. And those knowledge units, which actually have some preceding standards and organizations that they were building upon, weren&#8217;t necessarily built in the NICE framework.</p>
<p>We use the word ‘aligned’ to make sure that we&#8217;re aligned, that they can learn from what we&#8217;re doing and apply it, and we can learn from what they&#8217;re doing and apply it as well. So I think the biggest challenge is to take those existing organizations or initiatives that already are making great progress and have a lot of momentum, and making sure they&#8217;re in step with what we&#8217;re doing and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>Part of your work at the NICE program has been launching the CyberSeek database as well, which I think is probably one of the most publicly visible and publicly cited databases that the NIST cybersecurity program puts out there. It publishes data and statistics on cybersecurity job openings across the public and private sectors and other cyber workforce stats. Back when you launched it in 2016, what was the initial goal, and how do you think it&#8217;s helped to define some of the cyber workforce challenges that the country has faced over the last decade?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>At the time, there was a lot of speculation and a lot of survey data about what the cybersecurity workforce needed to be. If you asked any chief information security officer, how many workers do they need? They may say 10. When you ask the same question of, how many can you afford and how many do you plan to hire? The answer might be one. And so thankfully in 2014 when I came in, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act that Congress passed asked us to forecast what the workforce needs were, starting with the federal government and then looking also at the private sector.</p>
<p>So CyberSeek really came on the scene as an analytics tool, of course, in partnership with CompTIA and now Lightcast, to look at what are the actual jobs that are posted, to begin to quantify that, and then to do it in the context of the NICE framework. We&#8217;re looking more specifically at jobs to align to the NICE framework categories and work roles, and to do it not only nationally, but to do it by state and major metro area. And so whether you&#8217;re a member of Congress, or you may be at a college university, or you may be a local workforce board, and you really want to see what the demand is in your area, the CyberSeek tool not only gives you a number of open jobs in cyber security, but you can dissect that number to look at the types of jobs, what the requirements or qualifications are necessary to compete for those jobs, what&#8217;s the compensation for those jobs. I think bringing that all together really allows us to better forecast what the cybersecurity workforce needs are, both now and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>One of the major points in this conversation around cyber workforce was the 2023 national cyber workforce and education strategy. As you reflect on this cyber workforce and education issue becoming a national strategy led out of the White House, whether there are any really impactful outcomes from that strategy over the last couple of years, or whether there&#8217;s still some things on the to-do list that you&#8217;re particularly keeping track of even as you get ready for retirement?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>NICE really was an outgrowth of the 2008 Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. And as that later evolved and established the NICE program office, one of the things we were asked to do was provide some unification across the different investments happening in the federal government, and then by extension things that are happening in academia, in the private sector. And again, back in 2014 when Congress passed the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, they asked us to build upon successful existing programs. And then later in 2018 when the first Trump administration created an executive order asking us to come up with findings and recommendations. One of the things they asked us to do was an environmental scan of, again, existing programs and assess and evaluate their effectiveness.</p>
<p>So I think as a starting point, any new strategy, any new administration, any new person to this field, needs to acknowledge and research what currently exists and what&#8217;s being successful. What should we continue to do, versus what should we stop, or what should we change, or what should we introduce as a new initiative or a new platform? So I think when that previous administration’s National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy came out, there was a lot of effort, after some time, to take a step back and look at all the existing programs, not only in the federal government, but at the state and local level, in the private sector and academia, and then to build upon that.</p>
<p>And I think they did an excellent job of recognizing some of the good efforts that were already underway. And then fast forward to the present, I think the same is true. One of the biggest changes in my 11 years here has just been the proliferation and the growth and expansion of education and workforce efforts. And so that&#8217;s mostly a good thing, because it shows that we&#8217;re prioritizing and putting investments in place to both increase the supply and also find the demand. But at the same time, it makes NICE’s mission all the more important to make sure we&#8217;re creating a coordinated approach across the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>One of the facets of that [2023] strategy was strengthening the federal cyber workforce, and that&#8217;s, of course, a big area of interest for our audience. Do you have any assessment of all these different initiatives across the federal workforce, civilian side, defense side? As you mentioned, a lot of has sprung up over the last five or 10 years. How cohesive those are and how successful those have been, as we know this new administration is now looking at its own strategy?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>In 2015, Congress passed the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act, and that was an early effort to try to essentially identify the number of cybersecurity workers we had in the federal government and that we needed in the federal government. And again, to do that, we had to have some kind of standard to measure against. So the NICE framework was the required tool to use to do that measurement, especially to answer, how many cybersecurity workers do we need? We need a recruitment and retention strategy.</p>
<p>And I would say again, there were a lot of positive efforts led by the national cyber director, but also in partnership with the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Management and Budget, and all the departments and agencies like Commerce, NIST and others who needed that workforce to try to really continue to build momentum and fine tune the federal practices. One of our community subgroups talks about modernizing talent management, and this isn&#8217;t meant explicitly for the federal government, but for the private sector as well.</p>
<p>But I would say the federal government is in need of a lot of modernization. Going back to how we currently classify federal jobs, often that OPM classification series, a lot of them are 2210, IT or information security workforce [roles]. And yet the jobs, as the NICE framework represents, the work roles are much more specific than that. So I think there is an ongoing need to evolve that process, but I think some good progress has been made over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>How much progress do you think we&#8217;ve made in the shift towards skills based hiring?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>At a minimum, there&#8217;s increased awareness and the value and the importance that it brings. And really it comes down to relying less on traditional credentials like academic degrees and maybe even certifications and experience, and looking more specifically at the skills, knowledge, capabilities that a job candidate would bring to the workforce. I would think that most organizations, most hiring managers, most cybersecurity professionals, are on board with that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the practices still continue to lag. We still have job announcements that require the degrees, the experiences and things that really disqualify a vast majority of individuals who are probably quite capable. In fact, not only capable today, but have the potential to be the future workforce that is needed. So we need to limit those job announcements or job descriptions that disqualify people due to the lack of those traditional credentials, and really double down on the skills, the competencies that are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>More generally, you&#8217;ve written about the need for cybersecurity awareness among the workforce dating back to at least a decade now in your role at NIST. We now live in a world of annual cybersecurity trainings and PSAs. How would you grade cybersecurity awareness efforts over the past decade and just the level of acumen that we all generally have about cybersecurity?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>My answer is probably pretty similar to the one I just gave about, how are we doing for skills based education? The awareness programs, I would give an ‘A.’ The awareness efforts and the initiatives are very prolific. The outcomes, the behavioral change, is probably more a ‘C-minus.’ And I think what we&#8217;re all discovering with that gap is not that there isn’t good intentions, requirements or educational efforts in place. But it really comes down to changing behaviors, and we need to continue to look for more active ways to influence how employees or citizens or consumers make choices about what they do online and what they do with their computer and how they respond to phishing emails or whatever the case may be. The training, the one-way directional information flow, is not going to be enough. We need to look for more opportunities to simulate, to provide multimedia, to use exercises, to use performance based assessments and exams that really reinforce the behavior change we&#8217;re striving to direct.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Doubleday </strong>I have to bring it up: artificial intelligence. AI is on everyone&#8217;s mind. If you go on LinkedIn, there&#8217;s just so much speculation about how AI is going to completely change the future of a cybersecurity career field . . . I&#8217;d love to get your thoughts just on how you think about that and how the NIST NICE program has started to perhaps incorporate just some of the taxonomies and the skills that we&#8217;re seeing around AI come into play.</p>
<p><strong>Rodney Petersen </strong>It’s not just that AI is going to impact the future. AI is impacting the present, and I think we see that all around us. One example is in education. How is AI being used by students? How is it or can it be used by teachers and faculty members? How can it be used by the organizations or the enterprises that run schools and universities? Just last week, we had our K-12 cybersecurity education conference where we had a student panel, and much of their discussion was around their use, their daily use, their hourly use of AI. And they encourage teachers and administrators to embrace it, because it&#8217;s not going to go away, and it&#8217;s going to be, in their opinion, a helpful part of their learning and educational experience.</p>
<p>A lot of NICE’s focus starts around the impact on the education or the learning enterprise. But from a cybersecurity perspective, I think NIST and NICE as well, and I would add the Centers of Academic Excellence and Cybersecurity, have been primarily focused on three impacts. One is, how do we make sure AI technology is secure? How do we make sure security is built in by design, which is fundamental to all software, all hardware, all kind of technology considerations? And again, the NICE framework talks about design and development as a phase of the technology process life cycle where we need good cybersecurity practices.</p>
<p>We also think about how can AI be used for cybersecurity? How can those that are cybersecurity practitioners leverage AI for their benefit, all the way from writing code, monitoring against attacks and using it for defense, a variety of ways that we can leverage the benefits of AI for the cybersecurity of organizations. And then, thirdly, how do we defend against AI-generated attacks, which we are going to see increasingly. We’re seeing it presently. So it&#8217;s those three aspects: building it securely, how do we use it to our advantage, and how do we defend against that?</p><p>The post Outgoing NIST cyber workforce director talks job roles, skills-based hiring, and AI first appeared on Federal News Network.</p>
