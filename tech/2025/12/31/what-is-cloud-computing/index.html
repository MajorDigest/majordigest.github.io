<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id=""></h3>



<p>Cloud computing continues to be the platform of choice for large applications and a driver of innovation in enterprise technology. Gartner forecasts public cloud spending alone to  the public cloud services market alone will reach $1.42 trillion in current U.S. dollars, driven by AI workloads and enterprise modernization.</p>



<p>Driving this growth are the rise of AI and machine learning on the cloud, adoption of edge computing, the maturation of serverless computing, the emergence of multicloud strategies, improved security and privacy, and more sustainable cloud practices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-cloud-computing">What is cloud computing?</h3>



<p>While often used broadly, the term cloud computing is defined as an abstraction of compute, storage, and network infrastructure assembled as a platform on which applications and systems are deployed quickly and scaled on the fly.</p>



<p>Most cloud customers consume public cloud computing services over the internet, which are hosted in large, remote data centers maintained by cloud providers. The most common type of cloud computing, SaaS (software as service), delivers prebuilt applications to the browsers of customers who pay per seat or by usage, exemplified by such popular apps as Salesforce, Google Docs, or Microsoft Teams.</p>



<h3><strong> 5 top trends in cloud computing</strong></h3>

<ol style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
<li><strong>Agentic cloud ecosystems: </strong> The shift from AI as a tool to AI as an autonomous operator within cloud environments.</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign and localized clouds: </strong> Meeting strict national data residency and digital sovereignty laws.</li>
<li><strong>Specialized AI hardware access: </strong> Navigating the GPU capacity crunch through reserved instances and boutique AI clouds.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated greenOps: </strong>Merging cost optimization with mandatory carbon-footprint reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Industry-specific walled gardens: </strong> The maturation of vertical clouds into highly regulated, precompliant environments for finance and healthcare.</li>
</ol>






<p>Next in line is IaaS (infrastructure as a service), which offers vast, virtualized compute, storage, and network infrastructure upon which customers build their own applications, often with the aid of providers’ API-accessible services.</p>



<p>When people refer to the “the cloud” today, they most often mean the big IaaS providers: AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure. All three have become ecosystems of services that go way beyond infrastructure and include developer tools, serverless computing, machine learning services and APIs, data warehouses, and thousands of other services. With both SaaS and IaaS, a key benefit is agility. Customers gain new capabilities almost instantly without the capital investment in hardware or software on-premises — and they can instantly scale the cloud resources they consume up or down as needed.</p>



<p>According to Foundry’s Cloud Computing Study, 2025, enterprises are moving to the cloud to improve security and/or governance, increase scalability​, accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning and other new technologies, replace on-premises legacy technology, ​improve employee productivity, and ensure disaster recovery and business continuity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyperscalers-now-dominate-cloud-services">Hyperscalers now dominate cloud services</h3>



<p>The largest cloud service providers are often described as hyperscalers, due to their capability to provide large-scale data centers across the globe. Hyperscalers typically offer a wide range of cloud services, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and more.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, notable hyperscalers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. They offer the following capabilities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Hyperscalers can handle massive workloads and scale resources up or down quickly.</li>



<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong>: Hyperscalers often offer competitive pricing and economies of scale.</li>



<li><strong>Global reach</strong>: Hyperscalers operate data centers around the world, providing low-latency access to customers in different regions.</li>



<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Hyperscalers are at the forefront of cloud innovation, offering new services and features.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-of-working-with-hyperscalers">Challenges of working with hyperscalers</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong>: Relying heavily on a single hyperscaler can create vendor lock-in, making it difficult to switch to another provider and charging large egress fees if you do move.</li>



<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Hyperscalers offer a vast array of services, which can be overwhelming for some customers.</li>



<li><strong>Security concerns</strong>: Because hyperscalers handle sensitive data, security is a major concern.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI, Agents, and the Sovereign Cloud</strong></h3>



<p>The AI-enabled enterprise has moved beyond simple chatbots. The focus has shifted to <strong>agentic workflows </strong>— autonomous systems that reside in the cloud and possess the authority to execute business processes, manage cloud spend, and self-patch security vulnerabilities without human intervention.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The shift to agentic infrastructure</strong></h3>



<p>Cloud providers are no longer just selling compute. They are selling <strong>inference-as-a-service</strong>. Modern cloud budgets are now dominated by the high cost of specialized GPU clusters (such as Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture). This has led to the rise of boutique AI clouds that compete with hyperscalers by offering bare-metal access to the latest silicon specifically for model training and fine-tuning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data sovereignty and private AI</strong></h3>



<p>A major shift in late 2025 is the move away from public AI models for sensitive data. Organizations are increasingly using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) within walled garden environments. This ensures that a company’s proprietary data never leaves their specific cloud instance to train a provider’s base model.</p>



<p>Furthermore, sovereign AI has become a requirement for global operations. Governments now demand that the AI models processing their citizens’ data be hosted on infrastructure that is owned, operated, and governed within their own borders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The challenges of ghost AI</strong></h3>



<p>Just as shadow IT plagued the 2010s, ghost AI—unauthorized AI agents running on corporate cloud accounts — has become a primary security risk. Managing these autonomous entities requires a new layer of <strong>AI governance</strong>, where the cloud provider automatically audits the intent and permissions of every running agent to prevent runaway costs or data leaks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cloud-computing-definitions">Cloud computing definitions</h3>



<p>In 2011, NIST posted a PDF that divided cloud computing into three “service models” — SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS (platform as a service) — the latter being a controlled environment within which customers develop and run applications. These three categories have largely stood the test of time, although most PaaS solutions now are made available as services within IaaS ecosystems rather than as dedicated PaaS clouds.</p>



<p>Two evolutionary trends stand out since NIST’s threefold definition. One is the long and growing list of subcategories within SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS, some of which blur the lines between categories. The other is the explosion of API-accessible services available in the cloud, particularly within IaaS ecosystems. The cloud has become a crucible of innovation where many emerging technologies appear first as services, a big attraction for business customers who understand the potential competitive advantages of early adoption.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SaaS (software as a service) definition</strong></h3>



<p>This type of cloud computing delivers applications over the internet, typically with a browser-based user interface. Today, most software companies offer their wares via SaaS — if not exclusively, then at least as an option.</p>



<p>The most popular SaaS applications for business are Google’s G Suite and Microsoft’s Office 365. Most enterprise applications, including giant ERP suites from Oracle and SAP, come in both SaaS and on-premises versions. SaaS applications typically offer extensive configuration options as well as development environments that enable customers to code their own modifications and additions. They also enable data integration with on-prem applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>IaaS (infrastructure as a service) definition</strong></h3>



<p>At a basic level, IaaS cloud providers offer virtualized compute, storage, and networking over the internet on a pay-per-use basis. Think of it as a data center maintained by someone else, remotely, but with a software layer that virtualizes all those resources and automates customers’ ability to allocate them with little trouble.</p>



<p>But that’s just the basics. The full array of services offered by the major public IaaS providers is staggering: highly scalable databases, virtual private networks, big data analytics, AI and machine learning services, application platforms, developer tools, devops tools, and so on. Amazon Web Services was the first IaaS provider and remains the leader, followed by Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PaaS (platform as a service) definition</strong></h3>



<p>PaaS provides sets of services and workflows that specifically target developers, who can use shared tools, processes, and APIs to accelerate the development, testing, and deployment of applications. Salesforce’s Heroku and Salesforce Platform (formerly Force.com) are popular public cloud PaaS offerings; Cloud Foundry and Red Hat’s OpenShift can be deployed on premises or accessed through the major public clouds. For enterprises, PaaS can ensure that developers have ready access to resources, follow certain processes, and use only a specific array of services, while operators maintain the underlying infrastructure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FaaS (function as a service) definition</strong></h3>



<p>FaaS, the original and most basic version of serverless computing, adds another layer of abstraction to PaaS, so that developers are insulated from everything in the stack below their code. Instead of futzing with virtual servers, containers, and application runtimes, developers upload narrowly functional blocks of code, and set them to be triggered by a certain event (such as a form submission or uploaded file). All of the major clouds offer FaaS on top of IaaS: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and IBM Cloud Functions. A special benefit of FaaS applications is that they consume no IaaS resources until an event occurs, reducing pay-per-use fees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Private cloud definition</strong></h3>



<p>A private cloud downsizes the technologies used to run IaaS public clouds into software that can be deployed and operated in a customer’s data center. As with a public cloud, internal customers can provision their own virtual resources to build, test, and run applications, with metering to charge back departments for resource consumption. For administrators, the private cloud amounts to the ultimate in data center automation, minimizing manual provisioning and management.</p>



<p>VMware remains a force in the private cloud software market, but the acquisition by Broadcom has created confusion and raised concerns among some customers about potential changes in pricing, licensing, and support. This could lead some organizations to explore alternative solutions.</p>



<p>OpenStack continues to be a popular open-source choice for building private clouds. It offers a flexible and customizable platform that can be tailored to specific needs. However, OpenStack can be complex to deploy and manage, and it may require significant expertise to maintain.</p>



<p>Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform that has gained significant traction in recent years, is often used in conjunction with other technologies like OpenStack to build cloud-native applications. Red Hat OpenShift is a comprehensive cloud platform based on Kubernetes that provides a managed experience for deploying and managing container-based, applications.</p>



<p>Many cloud providers offer their own cloud-native platforms and tools, such as AWS Outposts, Azure Stack, and Google Cloud Anthos.</p>



<p>Common factors to consider when evaluating private cloud platforms include the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>: The initial cost of deployment and ongoing maintenance costs.</li>



<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: The level of technical expertise needed to manage the platform.</li>



<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The ability to customize the platform to meet specific needs.</li>



<li><strong>Vendor lock-in</strong>: The degree to which the organization is tied to a particular vendor.</li>



<li><strong>Security</strong>: The security features and capabilities of the platform.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The capability to expand the platform to meet future needs.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hybrid cloud definition</strong></h3>



<p>A hybrid cloud is the integration of a private cloud with a public cloud. At its most developed, the hybrid cloud involves creating parallel environments in which applications can move easily between private and public clouds. In other instances, databases may stay in the customer data center and integrate with public cloud applications — or virtualized data center workloads may be replicated to the cloud during times of peak demand. The types of integrations between private and public clouds vary widely, but they must be extensive to earn a hybrid cloud designation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Public APIs (application programming interfaces) definition</strong></h3>



<p>Just as SaaS delivers applications to users over the internet, public APIs offer developers application functionality that can be accessed programmatically. For example, in building web applications, developers often tap into the Google Maps API to provide driving directions; to integrate with social media, developers may call upon APIs maintained by Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. Twilio has built a successful business delivering telephony and messaging services via public APIs. Ultimately, any business can provision its own public APIs to enable customers to consume data or access application functionality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>iPaaS (integration platform as a service) definition</strong></h3>



<p>Data integration is a key issue for any sizeable company, but particularly for those that adopt SaaS at scale. iPaaS providers typically offer prebuilt connectors for sharing data among popular SaaS applications and on-premises enterprise applications, though providers may focus more or less on business-to-business and e-commerce integrations, cloud integrations, or traditional SOA-style integrations. iPaaS offerings in the cloud from such providers as Dell Boomi, Informatica, MuleSoft, and SnapLogic also let users implement data mapping, transformations, and workflows as part of the integration-building process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>IDaaS (identity as a service) definition</strong></h3>



<p>The most difficult security issue related to cloud computing is managing user identity and its associated rights and permissions across data centers and pubic cloud sites. IDaaS providers maintain cloud-based user profiles that authenticate users and enable access to resources or applications based on security policies, user groups, and individual privileges. The ability to integrate with various directory services (Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) and provide single sign-on across business-oriented SaaS applications is essential.</p>



<p>Leaders in IDaaS include Microsoft, IBM, Google, Oracle, Okta, Capgemini, Okta, Junio Corporation, OneLogin, and JumpCloud. <strong> </strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collaboration platforms</strong></h3>



<p>Collaboration solutions such as Slack and Microsoft Teams have become vital messaging platforms that enable groups to communicate and work together effectively. Basically, these solutions are relatively simple SaaS applications that support chat-style messaging along with file sharing and audio or video communication. Most offer APIs to facilitate integrations with other systems and enable third-party developers to create and share add-ins that augment functionality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vertical clouds</strong></h3>



<p>Key providers in such industries as financial services, healthcare, retail, life sciences, and manufacturing provide PaaS clouds to enable customers to build vertical applications that tap into industry-specific, API-accessible services. Vertical clouds can dramatically reduce the time to market for vertical applications and accelerate domain-specific B2B integrations. Most vertical clouds are built with the intent of nurturing partner ecosystems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Other cloud computing considerations</strong></h3>



<p>The most widely accepted definition of cloud computing means that you run your workloads on someone else’s servers, but this is not the same as outsourcing. Virtual cloud resources and even SaaS applications must be configured and maintained by the customer. Consider these factors when planning a cloud initiative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cloud computing security considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Objections to the public cloud generally begin with cloud security, although the major public clouds have proven themselves much less susceptible to attack than the average enterprise data center.</p>



<p>Of greater concern is the integration of security policy and identity management between customers and public cloud providers. In addition, government regulation may forbid customers from allowing sensitive data off-premises. Other concerns include the risk of outages and the long-term operational costs of public cloud services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multicloud management considerations</strong></h3>



<p>To enhance their operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve security, many companies are increasingly turning to multicloud strategies. By distributing workloads across multiple cloud providers, organizations can avoid vendor lock-in, optimize costs, and leverage the best-of-breed services offered by different providers.</p>



<p>This multicloud approach also improves performance and reliability by minimizing downtime and optimizing latency. Additionally, multicloud strategies strengthen security by diversifying the attack surface and facilitating compliance with industry regulations. Finally, by replicating critical workloads across multiple regions and providers, companies can establish robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans, ensuring minimal disruption in the event of catastrophic failures.</p>



<p>The bar to qualify as a multicloud adopter is low: A customer just needs to use more than one public cloud service. However, depending on the number and variety of cloud services involved, managing multiple clouds can become complex from both a cost optimization and a technology perspective.</p>



<p>In some cases, customers subscribe to multiple cloud services simply to avoid dependence on a single provider. A more sophisticated approach is to select public clouds based on the unique services they offer and, in some cases, integrate them. For example, developers might want to use Google’s Vertex AI Studio on Google Cloud Platform to build AI-driven applications, but prefer Jenkins hosted on the CloudBees platform for continuous integration.</p>



<p>To control costs and reduce management overhead, some customers opt for cloud management platforms (CMPs) and/or cloud service brokers (CSBs), which let you manage multiple clouds as if they were one cloud. The problem is that these solutions tend to limit customers to such common-denominator services as storage and compute, ignoring the panoply of services that make each cloud unique.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Edge computing considerations</strong></h3>



<p>You often see edge computing incorrectly described as an alternative to cloud computing. Edge computing is about moving compute to local devices in a highly distributed system, typically as a layer around a cloud computing core. There is typically a cloud involved to orchestrate all of the devices and take in their data, then analyze it or otherwise act on it. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To the cloud and back – why repatriation is real</strong></h3>



<p>While public cloud offers scalability and flexibility, some enterprises are opting to return to on-premises infrastructure due to rising costs, data security concerns, performance issues, vendor lock-in, and regulatory compliance challenges. While the public cloud offers scalability and flexibility, on-premises infrastructure provides greater control, customization, and potential cost savings in certain scenarios leading some technology decision-makers to consider repatriation. However, a hybrid cloud approach, combining public and private cloud, often offers the best balance of benefits.</p>



<p>More specific reasons to repatriate including the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unanticipated costs, such as data transfer fees, storage charges, and egress fees, can quickly escalate, especially for large-scale cloud deployments.  </li>



<li>Inaccurate resource provisioning or underutilization can lead to higher-than-expected costs.</li>



<li>Stricter data privacy regulations require organizations to store and process data within specific geographic boundaries.  </li>



<li>For highly sensitive data, companies may prefer to maintain greater control over security measures and access permissions. </li>



<li>On-premises infrastructure can offer lower latency, particularly for applications requiring real-time processing or high-performance computing.  </li>



<li>Overreliance on a single cloud provider can limit flexibility and increase costs. Repatriation allows organizations to diversify their infrastructure and reduce vendor dependency.  </li>



<li>Industries with stringent compliance requirements may find it easier to meet standards with on-premises infrastructure.  </li>



<li>On-premises environments offer greater control over hardware, software, and network configurations, allowing for customized solutions.  </li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits of cloud computing</strong></h3>



<p>The cloud’s main appeal is to reduce the time to market of applications that need to scale dynamically. Increasingly, however, developers are drawn to the cloud by the abundance of advanced new services that can be incorporated into applications, from machine learning to internet of things (IoT) connectivity.</p>



<p>Although businesses sometimes migrate legacy applications to the cloud to reduce data center resource requirements, the real benefits accrue to new applications that take advantage of cloud services and “cloud native” attributes. The latter include microservices architecture, Linux containers to enhance application portability, and container management solutions such as Kubernetes that orchestrate container-based services. Cloud-native approaches and solutions can be part of either public or private clouds and help enable highly efficient devops workflows.</p>



<p>Cloud computing, be it public or private or hybrid or multicloud, has become the platform of choice for large applications, particularly customer-facing ones that need to change frequently or scale dynamically. More significantly, the major public clouds now lead the way in enterprise technology development, debuting new advances before they appear anywhere else. Workload by workload, enterprises are opting for the cloud, where an endless parade of exciting new technologies invite innovative use.</p>



<p>SaaS has its roots in the ASP (application service provider) trend of the early 2000s, when providers would run applications for business customers in the provider’s data center, with dedicated instances for each customer. The ASP model was a spectacular failure because it quickly became impossible for providers to maintain so many separate instances, particularly as customers demanded customizations and updates.</p>



<p>Salesforce is widely considered the first company to launch a highly successful SaaS application using multitenancy — a defining characteristic of the SaaS model. Rather than each Salesforce customer getting its own application instance, customers who subscribe to the company’s salesforce automation software share a single, large, dynamically scaled instance of an application (like tenants sharing an apartment building), while storing their data in separate, secure repositories on the SaaS provider’s servers. Fixes can be rolled out behind the scenes with zero downtime and customers can receive UX or functionality improvements as they become available.</p>
