<p>On October 29, Microsoft Azure Front Door (AFD) experienced a global service disruption that impacted Microsoft 365, Azure Portal, and numerous dependent services including Microsoft Entra ID, App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Container Registry. First observed around 11:45 AM EDT, the outage stemmed from an inadvertent configuration change that caused AFD nodes across the global fleet to fail to load properly, resulting in HTTP 503 errors, connection timeouts, and immediate connection cancellations. After identifying the issue around 12:15 PM EDT, by 1:40 PM EDT Microsoft had blocked all new configuration changes and initiated a rollback to the last known good configuration. The incident was complicated by cascading failures: as unhealthy nodes dropped from the routing pool, traffic surges on remaining healthy nodes caused additional latency and errors. The disruption lasted approximately 8 hours, with Microsoft confirming mitigation at 8:05 PM EDT. Click here for an interactive view and here for a detailed analysis.</p>
