<section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"><div class="container"></div></section>



<p>For most of this past year, I’ve sat across from CEOs and executives discussing their next big initiatives, from new markets and AI to anything that might give them an edge. Despite the optimism, the moment we turned to strategy, their confident tone softened, as if conviction ran out halfway through the sentence. And I’ve felt that loss of conviction myself.</p>



<p>When I founded ProofHub over a decade ago, strategy followed a rhythm you could trust. We planned with reasonable confidence. We could forecast competitive dynamics, user behavior, procurement cycles and even industry direction with enough clarity to build multi-year product and go-to-market plans. There was time — time to learn, time to commit, time to execute. However, that rhythm is gone.</p>



<p>Today, strategic advantage decays faster than most organizations can update their understanding. A differentiator that once endured for five to seven years now holds for eighteen months, sometimes less. And in software, where distribution dynamics, switching costs and user expectations shift overnight, an advantage can lose half its value in a single quarter.</p>



<p>I think about this through the idea of the half-life of strategy — the time it takes for a strategic advantage to lose half of its value in the market. The shorter the half-life becomes, the more the organization must update its beliefs just to remain relevant. Those who succeed aren’t just faster at executing; they are faster at learning, too.</p>



<p>You can see this everywhere:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Roadmaps</strong> set a year out are obsolete six months in.</li>



<li><strong>Product categories</strong> redefine themselves mid-cycle.</li>



<li><strong>Procurement</strong> standards shift before contract terms expire.</li>



<li><strong>Vendor evaluations</strong> are rewritten after deployment, not before.</li>



<li><strong>Digital transformation</strong> programs finish just as the tech stack changes again.</li>
</ul>



<p>At first, you might think this is about being more agile, more innovative, or more aggressive. However, those are reactions, not solutions. The real shift is deeper: strategy no longer scales when the underlying assumptions expire too quickly. The advantage erodes because the environment moves faster than the organization’s ability to sense, understand and adapt to it.</p>



<p>For a long time, I tried to solve this by refining the strategic planning process by gathering more data, more forecasting and more scenario models. But analysis can only get you so far. What really matters is the rate of learning.</p>



<p>Strategic failure today is less about being wrong and more about staying wrong for too long. This article is about what changed when I stopped trying to make the world more predictable and instead focused on making my organization more adaptive by faster learning — where strategy is not a plan to be defended, but a system that can keep learning while it’s being executed. Let’s understand the issue first.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why strategy no longer matches the market speed</h3>



<p>The problem with most failing strategies isn’t just about market shifts, new technology updates, regulations and even customer psychology. It’s the viability of what a static plan can anticipate. What we call a “bad strategy” is often a good one that simply outlived its usefulness.</p>



<p>The factors that impact strategy are far too broad to list here, so I will summarise all those as “uncertainty.” It reframes the job from making the world predictable to making the organization adaptive.</p>



<p>When the half-life of advantage shortens, the cost of slow learning compounds. You can see it most clearly in areas where enthusiasm ran ahead of value realization. I am not saying that you should retreat from ambition. Instead, move ambition onto a learning clock that matches reality.</p>



<p>One way and perhaps the only one, out of uncertainty is to learn faster and closer to where the actual signals appear. Learning to me is the disciplined updating of beliefs when new evidence arrives. Every decision is a prediction about how things will work. When reality proves you wrong, learning is how you fix that prediction. In a stable environment, you can afford to learn slowly. However, in unstable ones, like today’s, slow learning becomes existential.</p>



<p>This is where I’ve watched many organizations, including my own, misinterpret the real challenge. It’s not a refusal to learn; it’s just that they learn too slowly. Signals show up at the edge, but our internal process to interpret, decide and act moves at a much slower pace. I call this gap the learning lag: the delay between when reality changes and when the organization builds enough understanding to respond to the changes.</p>



<p>You can notice the lag in small, repeatable ways: a market pattern we treat as a one-off story until it shows up in formal procurement requests,  a shift in how customers use our product that we ignore as noise until we see it in cancellation rates, a risk we discuss theoretically until it appears in an audit report.</p>



<p>By the time we approve a response and schedule the work, the opportunity has already passed.</p>



<p>The irony? Stronger governance and more alignment processes make this worse if they prioritize certainty over speed. The fix here is to make your organizational discipline support faster learning, not slow it down.</p>



<p>So I stopped trying to predict volatility and started closing the distance between detecting signals and making changes. That meant treating early evidence as something to test, not debate. It means treating plans as hypotheses to update, not positions to defend. The more quickly I could upgrade assumptions, without losing coherence, the more often my strategy stayed in sync with reality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where the learning lag actually happens</h3>



<p>If learning is now the real source of strategic advantage, the natural question is: where does the learning actually break down?</p>



<p>Organizations don’t fall behind all at once. They fall behind step by step: first in what they notice, then in how they interpret it, then in how long it takes to decide what to do and finally in how slowly they act.</p>



<p>Over the years, I’ve seen this learning lag show up in four predictable layers, each one compounding the next worse.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>1. Signal delay: When early shifts look like noise</h3>



<p>The earliest signs of strategic change almost always show up at the edge: in sales calls, support tickets, product feedback loops, procurement language, or competitive positioning statements that are still subtle. But these edge signals start weak(too weak to look like a real change)</p>



<p>So we wait. We wait for more data. More patterns. More proof.</p>



<p>And by the time the pattern is undeniable, the advantage in responding early is already gone.</p>



<p>A few years ago, we saw this play out in the creative tools market with Adobe and Figma. Adobe heard early signals that design teams were moving away from file-based workflows toward browser-native, real-time collaboration. Those signals first appeared in support communities, agency onboarding patterns and student design club preferences — all small, faint and easy to dismiss.</p>



<p>Internally, the narrative was: “Collaboration is already handled through Creative Cloud.” But at the edge, designers were saying something different: <em>“We want to design together in the same file, at the same time.”</em></p>



<p>Figma didn’t win because Adobe didn’t see the shift. Adobe saw it. The signal just didn’t meet the threshold of strategic concern early enough<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>By the time collaboration became a visible, quantifiable trend, the advantage had already shifted.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Sense-making delay: When we agree on what is happening, but not why</h3>



<p>Even when signals are acknowledged on time, teams rarely interpret them the same way. What the product team might see as a roadmap issue, marketing sees as a positioning issue. Finance sees risk. Support sees frustration. Leadership sees a narrative threat. Everyone is looking at the same pattern — but from different altitudes, incentives and fears. It’s not a disagreement on the evidence. It’s a disagreement on what it means.</p>



<p>Strategy stalls not because people refuse to change, but because they can’t agree on the <em>story</em> beneath the change. They chased precision in interpretation when the real advantage would have come from running small tests to find out faster which interpretation is correct.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>3. Decision delay: When the cost of waiting exceeds the cost of being wrong</h3>



<p>The hardest decisions are the ones where there’s no clean distinction between noise and signal, only judgment. And judgment moves more slowly inside large organizations than outside them. So decisions get pushed to the next planning cycle. The next budget review. The next governance checkpoint.</p>



<p>The organization thinks it is being careful. The market calls it hesitation.</p>



<p>The penalty for waiting is now higher than the penalty for occasionally being wrong early. That’s a deeply uncomfortable truth because it reverses how most of us were trained to manage risk.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Execution delay: When the organization understands the change but cannot absorb it fast enough</h3>



<p>Sometimes, everyone <em>sees</em> the shift. Everyone <em>agrees</em> on it. Everyone <em>decides</em> to act. And yet, nothing moves. Not because of unwillingness. But because the core operating system of the company is built for stability, not speed.</p>



<p>Even when the organization knows what is true, it cannot act in time.</p>



<p>This is where the gap turns from strategic to cultural. It’s not about intelligence. It’s about the metabolic rate at which the organization digests new truth and converts it into action.</p>



<p>For example, Ford recognized early that electrification would redefine the automotive landscape. The strategic belief was correct. The company invested in EV R&amp;D, partnerships and branding long before the market fully shifted. But the internal operating system, factory retooling cycles, dealer networks, procurement contracts and legacy software integration could not absorb the strategy fast enough.</p>



<p>By the time Ford aligned its manufacturing to the new strategy, companies like Tesla had already normalized the customer expectation, over-the-air updates, direct ordering and vertically integrated production. Ford wasn’t wrong about the future — it was simply too slow to become the company that the future required.</p>



<p>In environments where advantage decays quickly, recognizing reality is no longer enough. The organization has to be structurally capable of <em>letting go of its past</em> fast enough to meet it.</p>



<p>This pattern taught me that strategy no longer fails at the execution — it fails much earlier, in the micro-delays between perception, interpretation, decision and action. The faster the market shifts, the more those micro-delays become existential. So the task isn’t to design a more perfect strategy. It is to design a strategy that learns faster than the environment changes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The strategic shift from roadmap to learning system</h3>



<p>For most of my career, I treated strategy like architecture. Something you design carefully, review thoroughly and then execute with precision. That approach worked when markets moved in quarters or years. You could afford to be right upfront because the world wasn’t shifting fast enough to make your assumptions expire.</p>



<p>But that stability is gone. The world now moves faster than any upfront plan can keep up with. The moment strategy meets reality, the half-life clock starts ticking on how long it stays relevant.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean strategy is irrelevant. It means strategy can no longer be something we finish before we begin. It has to <em>keep pace</em> with the environment it’s meant to shape.</p>



<p>Over time, I found myself shifting from thinking of strategy as a roadmap to thinking of it as a learning system:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A roadmap is designed to be followed.</li>



<li>A learning system is designed to be updated.</li>
</ul>



<p>In a roadmap model, learning happens <em>between</em> planning cycles. In a learning system, learning happens <em>during</em> execution. The work itself becomes the way you update your assumptions.</p>



<p>In the process, I had to abandon the idea that clarity is something you secure upfront. In fast-moving environments, clarity is something you accumulate over time — through experiments, feedback loops and constant revision. The measure of good strategy today is how little friction there is in updating it when the future behaves differently than expected.</p>



<p>This realization led me to the framework that now guides how I lead: strategy must operate at two different speeds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Leading at two speeds: Slow core, fast edge</h3>



<p>The shift from roadmap to learning system led me to see that every organization already runs on two tempos. The edge moves fast: new products, new technologies, new experiments, new signals. The core moves slowly: brand, governance, culture, identity and financial discipline. When these two tempos are out of sync, strategy begins to decay.</p>



<p>Leading today means designing deliberately for both.</p>



<p>I didn’t recognize this at first. Either everything was urgent, or everything had to be proven. Both approaches created drag. The breakthrough came when I stopped asking, “How do we make the company move faster?” and started asking, “<em>What actually needs to move fast — and what must remain slow so the fast parts don’t fall apart?”</em></p>



<p>Over time, the distinction became clear:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The fast edge</strong> is where learning happens. It is sensing, experimenting, testing assumptions and responding to shifts while the cost of being wrong is still low. This shows up in product iterations, pricing probes, pilot features, customer conversations and market feel. The edge is exploratory by design.</li>



<li><strong>The slow core</strong> is where meaning compounds. It holds the principles, values, operating norms, architectural commitments and identity that shouldn’t change every time the environment does. The core prevents chaos from pretending to be agility. It ensures that adaptation doesn’t dissolve coherence.</li>
</ul>



<p>The challenge here is not designing these two speeds. Every company already <em>has</em> them by default. The challenge is making them aware of each other.</p>



<p>When the edge learns something new, the core needs to absorb it without treating it as a disruption. And when the core protects what matters, the edge needs freedom to explore without feeling constrained.</p>



<p>The companies that struggle try to move the core at the speed of the edge (which creates chaos) or force the edge to move at the speed of the core (which creates stagnation). The work now is to choreograph the two.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Strategy is never finished</h3>



<p>For decades, leaders were rewarded for certainty. The world we now operate in doesn’t offer that kind of certainty anymore. The future arrives faster than the systems built to meet it. Strategy used to be about predicting the world and positioning ourselves correctly. Today, it’s about staying in dialogue with the world — updating what we believe as the world shows us who it’s becoming.</p>



<p>When I look back at the strategies that stalled, my own included, the failure was rarely intellectual. The strategy made sense. The data supported it. The narrative felt strong. The failure was in how slowly the organization evolved its understanding of the world. The failure was in how long we held onto beliefs that were already expiring.</p>



<p>What I’ve learned is that strategy is no longer something you finish<strong>.</strong> It is something you maintain. It’s a living system — a continuous conversation between what we intend and what reality teaches us.</p>



<p>A strategy, in the end, is just a bet with a learning deadline.</p>
