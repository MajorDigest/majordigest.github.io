<p>Windows 10 has reached the end of mainstream support, which means most users will no longer receive new features, bug fixes, or security updates. Microsoft encourages businesses and individuals to upgrade to Windows 11. </p>



<p>Another option is to purchase extended security updates for Windows 10. Those enrolled in the Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) program will receive monthly security updates, but no new feature releases.</p>



<p>In this story we summarize what you need to know about each update released for the most recent versions of Windows 10 — versions 22H2 and 21H2. (Microsoft releases updates for those two versions together.) For each build, we’ve included the date of its initial release and a link to Microsoft’s announcement about it. The most recent updates appear first.</p>



<p><em>For details about how to install and manage Windows updates, see “How to handle Windows 10 and 11 updates.” </em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="updates-to-windows-10-versions-21h2-and-22h2">Updates to Windows 10 versions 21H2 and 22H2</h3>



<p>As of November 2025, only computers enrolled in the Windows 10 ESU program (or those with a Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 or 2024 license) will receive Windows 10 updates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-kb5073724-os-builds-19045-6809-and-19044-6809">Windows 10 KB5073724 (OS Builds 19045.6809 and 19044.6809)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>



<p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Windows 10 ESU</p>



<p>This Patch Tuesday update includes a subset of high-confidence device targeting data that identifies devices eligible to automatically receive new Secure Boot certificates. Devices will receive the new certificates only after demonstrating sufficient successful update signals, ensuring a safe and phased deployment.</p>



<p>It also fixes one bug, in which some security software might have detected the Windows core component, WinSqlite3.dll as being as vulnerable. </p>



<p>The build also has a wide variety of security updates. For details, see Microsoft’s Security Update Guide and January 2026 Security Updates.</p>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know:</strong> Because this is a security update, it should be applied relatively soon. Over the next few weeks, check for reports about problematic issues, and if all seems well, apply the update.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> December 18, 2025</p>



<p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Windows 10 ESU</p>



<p>This update fixes a bug in the Message Queuing (MSMQ) functionality. This bug also affected a clustered MSMQ environment under load. This issue could have led to message queues becoming inactive, messages about insufficient resources, applications unable to write to message queues, error messages about the message cannot be created, or messages about insufficient disk space or memory. This issue primarily affected enterprise or managed IT environments.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> December 9, 2025</p>



<p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Windows 10 ESU</p>



<p>In this update, PowerShell’s Invoke-WebRequest command now includes a confirmation prompt with a security warning of a script execution risk. You can choose to continue or cancel the request. For additional details, see CVE-2025-54100 and KB5074596: PowerShell 5.1: Preventing script execution from web content.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>



<p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Windows 10 ESU</p>



<p>This update fixes a bug in which after installing the October 14, 2025 Windows update (KB5066791), the message “Your version of Windows has reached the end of support” might incorrectly display in the Windows Update Settings page. To view the page, click <em>Start > Settings > Windows Update</em>.</p>

<p>Note that today marks the official end of support for Windows 10 Home, Pro, and Enterprise, except for organizations and individuals enrolled in Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates program.</p>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know:</strong> Because this is a security update, it should be applied relatively soon. Over the next few weeks, check for reports about problematic issues, and if all seems well, apply the update.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> September 25, 2025</p>



<p>This build fixes two bugs, one in which you might not be able to connect to shared files and folders if you’re using the Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol on NetBIOS over TCP/IP NetBIOS (NetBT), and another in which those using Windows Autopilot to deploy Windows 10, version 22H2 to devices with the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) configured might find that the ESP doesn’t load during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE).</p>

<p>Note: In this build there are reports of blurry or unclear CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) text when displayed at 96 DPI (100% scaling) in Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. The issue is due to limited pixel density at 96 DPI, which can reduce the clarity and alignment of CJK characters. Increasing the display scaling improves clarity by enhancing text rendering.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-november-2021-update-version-21h2">Windows 10 November 2021 Update (version 21H2)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> November 16, 2021</p>



<p>Version 21H2, called the Windows 10 November 2021 Update, is the second feature update to Windows 10 released in 2021. Here’s a quick summary of what’s new:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wi-Fi security has been enhanced with WPA3 H2E standards support.</li>



<li>GPU compute support has been added in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows (EFLOW) deployments for machine learning and other compute-intensive workflows.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also a number of features designed for IT and business:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Windows Hello for Business has a new deployment method called cloud trust that simplifies passwordless deployments.</li>



<li>For increased security, there have been changes to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) VPN APIs, which includes the ability to implement common web-based authentication schemes and to reuse existing protocols.</li>



<li>Apps can now be provisioned from Azure Virtual Desktop. This allows those apps to run just like local apps, including the ability to copy and paste between remote and local apps.</li>



<li>The release closes the gap between Group Policy and mobile device management (MDM) settings. The device configuration settings catalog has been updated to list more than 1,400 settings previously not available for configuration via MDM. The new MDM policies include administrative template (ADMX) policies, such as App Compat, Event Forwarding, Servicing, and Task Scheduler.</li>



<li>An upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise includes Universal Print, which now supports print jobs of up to 1GB or a series of print jobs from an individual user that add up to 1GB within any 15-minute period.</li>



<li>Universal Print integrates with OneDrive for web and Excel for web. This allows users of any browser or device connected to the internet to print documents hosted in OneDrive for web to a printer in their organization without installing printer drivers on their devices.</li>
</ul>



<p>Microsoft has also announced that starting with this release, Windows 10 will get feature updates only once a year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-may-2021-update-version-21h1">Windows 10 May 2021 Update (version 21H1)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> May 18, 2021</p>



<p>Version 21H1, called the Windows 10 May 2021 Update, is the most recent update to Windows 10. This is a relatively minor update, but it does have a few new features.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of what’s new in 21H1:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Windows Hello multicamera support</strong>: If you have an external Windows Hello camera for your PC, you can set the external camera as your default camera. (Windows Hello is used for signing into PCs.) Why should this change matter to you? If you have an external camera, you probably bought it because it’s superior to the built-in, internal one on your computer. So with this change, you’ll be able to use the more accurate camera for logging into your PC.</li>



<li><strong>Improved Windows Defender Application Guard performance:</strong> Windows Defender Application Guard lets administrators configure applications to run in an isolated, virtualized container for improved security. With this change, documents will open more quickly. It can currently take up to a minute to open an Office document in it.</li>



<li><strong>Better Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Group Policy Service support</strong>: Microsoft has made it easier for administrators to change settings to support remote work.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-october-2020-update-version-20h2">Windows 10 October 2020 Update (version 20H2)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> October 20, 2020</p>



<p>Version 20H2, called the Windows 10 October 2020 Update, is the most recent update to Windows 10. This is a relatively minor update but does have a few new features.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of what’s new in 20H2:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The new Chromium-based version of the Microsoft Edge browser is now built directly into Windows 10.</li>



<li>The System page of Control Panel has been removed. Those settings have been moved to the Settings app.</li>



<li>The Start menu’s tiled background will match your choice of Windows themes. So the tiled background will be light if you’re using the Windows 10 light theme and dark if you’re using the Windows 10 dark theme.</li>



<li>When you use Alt-Tab, Edge will now display each tab in your browser in a different Alt-Tab window. Previously, when you used Alt-Tab, Edge would get only a single window. You can change this new behavior by going to <em>Settings > System > Multitasking</em>.</li>



<li>When you pin a site to the taskbar in Edge, you can click or mouse over its icon to see all your browser tabs that are open for that website.</li>



<li>When you detach a keyboard on a 2-in-1 device, the device will automatically switch to the tablet-based interface. Previously, you were asked whether you wanted to switch. You can change that setting by going to <em>Settings > System > Tablet</em>.</li>



<li>The Your Phone app gets a variety of new features for some Samsung devices. When using one of the devices, you can interact with the Android apps on your phone from the Your Phone app on Windows 10.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know: </strong>Windows 10 version 20H2 also has a variety of small changes of note for sysadmins and those in IT.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>IT professionals who administer multiple mobile devices get a new Modern Device Management (MDM) “Local Users and Groups” settings policy that mirrors options available for devices that are managed through Group Policy.</li>



<li>Windows Autopilot, used to set up and configure devices in enterprises, has gained a variety of small enhancement, including better deployment of HoloLens devices, the addition of co-management policies, enhancements to Autopilot deployment reporting, and the ability to reuse Configuration Manager task sequences to configure devices.</li>



<li>Microsoft Defender Application Guard now supports Office. This allows untrusted Office documents from outside an enterprise to launch in an isolated container to stop potentially malicious content from compromising computers or exploiting personal information found on them.</li>



<li>Latest Cumulative Updates (LCUs) and Servicing Stack Updates (SSUs) have been combined into a single cumulative monthly update, available via Microsoft Catalog or Windows Server Update Services.</li>



<li>Biometric sign-on has been made more secure. Windows Hello now has support for virtualization-based security for certain fingerprint and face sensors, which protects, isolates, and secures a user’s biometric authentication data.</li>
</ul>



<p>For more details, see Microsoft’s “What’s new for IT pros in Windows 10, version 20H2.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-may-2020-update-version-2004">Windows 10 May 2020 Update (version 2004)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date: </strong>May 27, 2020</p>



<p>Version 2004, called the Windows 10 May 2020 Update, is the most recent update to Windows 10. This is a relatively minor update but does have a variety of new features for both users and system administrators. For more details, see: “Review: Windows 10 May 2020 Update delivers little tweaks that add up to… well, not a lot.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of what’s new in 2004:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cortana now runs as a standalone app in a resizable window. It also loses a variety of capabilities, such as playing music, controlling home devices, and working on the lock screen.</li>



<li>Task Manager now displays new information, including the temperature of your GPU and your disk type.</li>



<li>Settings gets many small tweaks, including adding a header with account information, and a redone network status page that combines information that used to be found on multiple pages, such as your IP address, current connection properties and data usage.</li>



<li>The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) gets more features. It now uses a real Linux kernel, and is faster than previously.</li>



<li>IT can now take advantage of Windows Hello biometrics logins rather than passwords, by setting that up as the default on enterprise devices.</li>



<li>Installing and setting up Windows for others has been made easier thanks to new controls added to Dynamic Update, which can lead to less downtime during installation for users.</li>



<li>A variety of new commands have been given to PowerShell for Delivery Optimization, a Windows networking service that reduces bandwidth consumption by sharing the work of downloading update and upgrade packages among multiple devices in business deployments.</li>



<li>The security of the Chromium version of Edge has been improved, thanks to porting Application Guard to it.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-november-2019-update-version-1909">Windows 10 November 2019 Update (version 1909)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> Nov. 12, 2019</p>



<p>Version 1909, called the Windows 10 November 2019 Update, is the most recent update to Windows 10. There are very few new features in this update, making it more like a service pack of old than a feature update. At this point it’s not clear whether in the future there will be one full-featured update and one service-pack-like update per year or whether Microsoft will go back to its two-feature-updates-a-year schedule. For more details, see “What we know so far about the unusual Windows 10 1909” and “5 unanswered questions about Windows 10 1909.”</p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of what’s new for users in 1909.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It lets you create calendar events straight from the taskbar. To do it, click the time on the taskbar and you’ll open the Calendar view. Now click a date and time, then type the event’s name into the text box. You’ll also be able to choose the date, time and location.</li>



<li>When you type a search into the search box, it will now search through files in your OneDrive account as well as on your PC. Also, as you type, a drop-down menu with suggested files appears. Click a file to open it.</li>



<li>Voice assistants in addition to Cortana, including Amazon’s Alexa, will be able to run on Windows 10’s lock screen.</li>



<li>Under-the-hood improvements should speed up the performance of some PCs, as well as increase the battery life in some laptops.</li>



<li>The Start Menu has gotten minor tweaks. When you hover over items in the navigation pane on the left side of the menu, the items clearly show what you’re about to click.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know: </strong>The following features in 1909 are of note for IT staff.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Windows containers no longer need to have their host and container versions match. That requirement restricted Windows from supporting mixed-version container pod scenarios. Previously, containers from older versions of Windows 10 couldn’t be run on newer versions of Windows 10. In this update, it’s possible, so that a container made using 1903, for example, can be run on 1909.</li>



<li>Windows Defender Credential Guard, which protects enterprise users’ logins and credentials against theft, is now available for ARM64 devices. Some Windows 10 convertible PCs use ARM64.</li>



<li>Enterprises can now use Microsoft’s Intune enterprise mobility management (EMM) service to allow devices running Windows 10 in S mode to install and run Win32 (desktop) apps. Before this, S Mode only allowed devices to run apps from the Microsoft Store. Microsoft Store apps don’t run on the desktop.</li>



<li>The security of BitLocker encryption has been improved. Whenever BitLocker is used to encrypt a device, a recovery key is created, but before this security improvement, it was possible for an unauthorized user to get access to the recovery key and decrypt the device. Now, PCs have additional security if a key is exposed. Here’s how Microsoft explains the change: “Key-rolling or Key-rotation feature enables secure rolling of Recovery passwords on MDM managed AAD devices upon on demand request from Microsoft Intune/MDM tools or upon every time recovery password is used to unlock the BitLocker protected drive.”</li>
</ul>



<p>There are two known issues in this update: one in which some users cannot set Win32 program defaults for certain app and file type combinations using the Open with… command or Settings > Apps > Default apps, and another in which Microsoft Notepad and other Win32 programs cannot be set as default applications.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-october-2018-update-version-1809">Windows 10 October 2018 Update (version 1809)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> October 2, 2018; paused October 5; re-released November 13, 2018</p>



<p>Version 1809, called the Windows 10 October 2018 Update, is the feature update that preceded the May 2019 Update. Here’s a quick summary of what’s new for users in it. (For more details, see our full review.)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A new, powered-up Windows Clipboard can hold multiple clips, store clips permanently, let you preview clips and choose which one you’d like to paste into a document, and share clips across Windows 10 devices.</li>



<li>A new screenshot and annotation tool called Snip & Sketch lets you capture and annotate the entire screen, a rectangular portion of the screen or a freehand-drawn portion of it. After you take a screen capture, you can annotate it and then save it to a file, copy it to the Clipboard, open it in another program or share it via email, social media and other methods.</li>



<li>Storage Sense, which helps save storage space, now works with OneDrive Files On-Demand to clean out files you’ve downloaded from OneDrive cloud storage to your PC but that you don’t use any longer. You can choose how long you would like the cloud files to stay on your PC unused before you want them deleted, from never to 60 days.</li>



<li>The Microsoft Edge browser lets you set autoplay permissions for sound and video on websites on a site-by-site basis. It also lets you look up word definitions in its built-in eReader for books and PDFs, and mark up PDFs and books using a highlighter and by adding notes.</li>



<li>The new Your Phone app links Windows 10 devices to iOS and Android phones. It allows you to start web browsing on an iOS or Android device and then continue where you left off on your PC. It also lets you view photos on your Android phone from your Windows 10 PC.</li>



<li>Search Previews have been powered up slightly. You no longer need to click to display the preview panel; it opens automatically. It also now shows files found on your PC.</li>



<li>Smaller changes include a new dark theme for File Explorer; the addition of the SwiftKey swipe keyboard, which lets you enter text by swiping a finger across an onscreen keyboard; updates that are less intrusive; and faster sign-ins on shared PCs.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know: </strong>There are few significant changes that affect IT in the Windows 10 October 2018 Update, other than New Microsoft Edge Group Policies that let admins enable and disable full-screen mode, printing, the favorites bar, and browser history saves. IT can also allow or ban Edge extensions (not that there are many available) and configure the Home button and new tab page and startup options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-april-2018-update-version-1803">Windows 10 April 2018 Update (version 1803)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> April 30, 2018</p>



<p>Version 1803, called the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, is the major update to Windows 10 that preceded the October 2018 Update. Here’s a quick summary of what’s new for users in it. (For more details, <u>see our full review</u>.)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The most important new feature is Timeline, which lets you review and resume activities and open files you’ve started on your PC, or any other Windows PCs you have. It also tracks what you’ve done on iOS and Android devices if you install Microsoft’s digital assistant Cortana on them and are logged in. It shows a list of activities day by day for up to 30 days. Each activity shows up as a large tile, with the file name and document title or URL and website name across it, and the name of the application or app that created it across the top. Click any activity to reopen it. (Note that at present, Timeline only tracks activities in certain Microsoft programs such as the Edge browser and Office applications.)</li>



<li>The new Diagnostic Data Viewer is supported, which Microsoft is designed to let you see the “diagnostic data collected from your Windows devices, how it is used, and to provide you with increased control over that data.” However, the information is presented in such a complex, technical way that even programmers will likely have a difficult time understanding it. The viewer isn’t built directly into the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Instead, you have to download it from the Microsoft Store.</li>



<li>The My People feature now lets you pin up to 10 contacts on the Windows taskbar. Previously, you could only pin up to three.</li>



<li>Microsoft Edge gets several minor tweaks, including a revamped Hub, the ability to mute auto-playing audio in tabs, and a forms-filler for web-based forms.</li>



<li>The Notebook feature of Cortana gets a new, cleaner interface for its Notebook. It now has two tabs, Organizer and Manage Skills. The Organizer makes it easier to create lists and set reminders. The Manage Skills tab lets you add “skills” to Cortana, such as controlling your home and its appliances, connecting Cortana to music services such as Spotify, tracking your fitness and more.</li>



<li>You get more control over app permissions, such as whether they can access your camera, location and contacts.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know: </strong>IT staff should be aware of these features that are new in the Windows 10 April 2018 Update:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Windows 10 Professional now gets the Windows Defender Application Guard, which protects Microsoft Edge. There’s also a new feature in the application guard that lets users download files inside Edge instead of directly to the operating system, as a way to increase security.</li>



<li>There are new policies for Group Policy and Mobile Device Management (MDM) that can better control how Delivery Optimization is used for Windows Update and Windows Store app updates. You can also now monitor Delivery Optimization using Windows Analytics.</li>



<li>Windows AutoPilot also gets a tweak that lets IT make sure policies, settings and apps are provisioned on devices before users begin using them.</li>



<li>Windows gets the Linux <code>curl</code> and <code>tar</code> utilities for downloading files and extracting .tar archives built directly into Windows. Windows also now natively supports Unix sockets (AF_UNIX) with a new <code>afunix.sys</code> kernel driver. That will make it easier to port software to Windows from Linux as well as from other Unix-like operating systems.</li>



<li>There are a host of improvements to the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which lets you run a variety of Linux distributions on Windows 10. Linux applications can run in the background, some launch settings for Linux distributions can be customized, and Linux applications have been given access to serial devices. The new Unix sockets report is available for the Windows Subsystem for Linux as well as Windows itself.</li>



<li>The Windows 10 Pro for Workstations version of Windows 10 gets a new power scheme called Ultimate Performance it’s only for desktop PCs, not those that can be powered by batteries. In addition, Windows 10 Pro for Workstations no longer ships with games like Candy Crush or other similar consumer-focused apps. Instead, it features enterprise- and business-related apps.</li>



<li>Administrators have been given the power to configure an enterprise’s PCs to run custom scripts during feature updates, which will make configuration and deployment easier.</li>
</ul>



<p>For  more details, see the Microsoft blog post “Making IT simpler with a modern workplace.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-fall-creators-update-version-1709">Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> October 17, 2017</p>



<p>Version 1709, called the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, is the major update to Windows 10 that preceded the April 2018 Update. Here’s a quick summary of what’s new for users in it. (For more details, see our full review.)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>OneDrive gets a new feature called Files On-Demand that gives you access to all of your OneDrive files on every device, without having to download them first. You’ll be able to see all the files you have in OneDrive, even if they’re only in the cloud and not on your PC. Icons tell you which are local and which are in the cloud. Just open the file, and if it’s not on your PC, it gets downloaded.</li>



<li>The new My People feature lets you pin three contacts to the Windows taskbar and then communicate with them instantly without having to open a separate app such as Skype or Mail. You can also click to see a list of all communications between them and you at a glance.</li>



<li>You can now send web links from your iOS or Android device to your PC and have them open in Microsoft Edge.</li>



<li>Cortana gets several new features, including displaying results in a scrollable flyout panel, so you don’t have to launch a web browser.</li>



<li>Microsoft Edge gets some minor improvements, including better Favorites handling and the ability to mark up PDFs and e-books.</li>



<li>Security has been beefed up, including the addition of Windows Defender Exploit Guard, which includes intrusion rules and policies to protect against a variety of threats, notably zero-day exploits. A new anti-ransomware feature called Controlled Folder Access has also been added; it lets only approved apps have access to Windows system files and folders.</li>



<li>New privacy features include the ability to review the kinds of devices and services apps from the Microsoft Store want access to before you download them.</li>



<li>The update incorporates Microsoft’s new design system and guidelines, called Fluent Design. Overall, transitions are smoother, and there are subtle changes to the transparency effect.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know:</strong> IT staff should be aware of these features that are new in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The notoriously insecure SMBv1 networking protocol, exploited in recent ransomware attacks including WannaCry and Petya, won’t be included on clean installs of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, but SMBv1 components will remain if you do in-place upgrades on PCs that already have the component installed.</li>



<li>Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), a suite of tools introduced in Windows 10 that helps enterprise customers protect their users and networks against threats and respond to attacks, is being beefed up. Among other things, it will run on the Windows Server OS.</li>



<li>ATP is also part of Windows Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge, available only for Windows 10 Enterprise Edition. It protects against malware attacks by confining visits to unknown or untrusted websites to a virtual machine, so that attacks can’t spread to a PC or the network.</li>



<li>Windows AutoPilot, which improves self-service deployments of Windows 10 PCs, gets a variety of tweaks, including better mobile device management (MDM) services.</li>



<li>Windows Analytics’ new Device Health tool gathers information on how PCs perform in an enterprise, and based on that, identifies potential issues and outlines steps to resolve them.</li>



<li>Enterprises get more control over what kind of information Windows Analytics gathers for the IT staff. In order to improve users’ privacy, IT staff can limit the information collected by Windows Analytics to only diagnostic data.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-10-creators-update-version-1703">Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> April 5, 2017</p>



<p>Version 1703, dubbed the Creators Update, is the major update to Windows 10 that preceded the Fall Creators Update. Here’s a quick summary of what’s new for users in the Creators Update. (For more details, see our full review.)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It helps you better organize the Start menu by letting you put multiple tiles for apps into a single folder — for example, you can group all social media apps into one folder.</li>



<li>Users are given a bit more control over the update process: They can delay an update for three days and keep delaying it in three-day increments, or choose specific times for updates to install.</li>



<li>The Edge browser has gotten some improvements, including having Flash disabled by default for security reasons and supporting the ePub and PDF formats for reading books and other content.</li>



<li>Microsoft added some 3D and virtual reality features, including running HoloLens virtual reality and mixed reality apps for the first time, and introducing a Paint 3D app for creating 3D objects.</li>



<li>System settings that previously were in multiple locations have been consolidated into the Settings app.</li>



<li>There’s a new all-in-one security dashboard called Windows Defender Security Center that consolidates many security and computer health settings and information.</li>



<li>New gaming features include streaming gaming sessions over the internet; a Game Mode to improve gaming performance; and a Game bar to let you record your gameplay, take screenshots and perform games-related tasks.</li>



<li>The Cortana personal assistant gets a few modest additions, including scheduling monthly reminders and helping you set up devices.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know: </strong>IT staff should be aware of these features that are new in the Windows 10 Creators Update:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Security has been improved in a number of ways, including adding new features and insights into Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) to better investigate and respond to network threats. Among the new features are sensors in memory, better intelligence and improved remediation capabilities.</li>



<li>Several new configuration service providers (CSPs) available in the Creators Update let administrators manage Windows 10 devices through Mobile Device Management (MDM) or provisioning packages. The DynamicManagement CSP, for instance, can enable or disable certain device features depending on location, network presence or time.</li>



<li>New mobile application management capabilities can protect data on personal mobile devices without requiring each device to be part of the corporate MDM.</li>



<li>The Windows Configuration Designer (previously called Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer) includes new wizards to make it easier to create provisioning packages, including for desktop devices, Windows mobile devices, Surface Hub devices, HoloLens devices and kiosk devices.</li>



<li>Enterprise security administrators get a more comprehensive documentation library for Windows Defender Antivirus.</li>



<li>If an enterprise-wide update policy hasn’t been configured, users with Windows Pro, Windows Enterprise or Windows Education editions have much more control over how Windows updates.
