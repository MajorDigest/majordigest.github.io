     <p>While Verizon had a good few months, with the last major outage occurring in October 2024, it seems that the popular United States wireless carrier is having some issues. So, if you're on Verizon and seeing 'SOS' in place of network bars, you're not alone.</p><p>Countless users have taken to social platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Threads to shout issues, but reported problems with Verizon have spiked on Down Detector to over 46,000.</p><p>We've just reached out to Verizon to ask what's going on with its network, but in the meantime, we're spinning up a TechRadar live blog to report on this potential outage as it happens.</p><p>The spike is real on Down Detector – as of 12:16PM ET there are over 46,000 reported outages and a few of my colleagues who use Veirzon are seeing 'SOS' in place of network bars on there iPhones.</p><p>For those counting, Down Detector is now at over 90,000 reported issues, with many in the comments noting that on their phones, 'SOS' is appearing instead of network bars. This likely indicates that the device can't reach the cellular network and instead defaults to satellite connectivity, a feature offered by the iPhone and other smartphones.</p><p>Here's a look at what that looks like, courtesy of TechRadar's Editor-at-Large, Lance Ulanoff's iPhone 17 Pro Max, which is connected to Verizon's network here in New York City.</p><h3 id="verizon-s-own-network-status-isn-t-showing-any-issues-2">Verizon's own Network Status isn't showing any issues</h3><p>Interestingly, Verizon's Network Status checker doesn't appear to show any issues, and I've tried plugging in a few different locations to get it to update. Please let us know in the comments if you're on Verizon and experiencing this outage.</p><p>Based on social media posts and Down Detector comments, it's clear that the New York Metro Region, Texas, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and South Carolina are experiencing issues.</p><p>I am also encountering a 'please try again' pop-up when using the tool, so it might be experiencing an outage.</p><p>I am keeping an eye on Verizon's own social channels – mainly @Verizon, @VerizonSupport, and @VerizonNews on X – to see if any comment or acknowledgment is being issued, but there's nothing as of yet.</p><p>Meanwhile, here's a sampling of impacted users taking to social platforms to report issues with Verizon.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who else has a Verizon outage? I have no service, full SOS in North Carolina.January 14, 2026</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Verizon is having a major outage again. My iPhone is down to no service but my galaxy on unlimited welcome is fine. pic.twitter.com/KwRHsVIgpGJanuary 14, 2026</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h3 id="i-use-visible-one-of-verizon-mvno-s-and-still-have-service-2">I use Visible, one of Verizon MVNO's, and still have service</h3><p>I swapped from Verizon to Visible this past November during the carrier's Black Friday - Cyber Monday sale and am still seeing service on my iPhone 17 Pro Max, actually 5GUW with two bars of service.</p><p>Now, Visible is Verizon's MVNO, which means it's a 'mobile virtual network operator' that actually offers its service via Verizon's network, so it's peculiar that it's not impacted by the outage ... at least as of yet.</p><h3 id="verizon-just-confirmed-the-issue-with-techradar-and-is-working-on-a-fix-2">Verizon just confirmed the issue with TechRadar and is working on a fix</h3><p>We've heard back from a Verizon spokesperson, and the carrier has confirmed that an issue is impacting its network.</p><p><em>"We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience."</em></p><p>Verizon states that it's aware of the issue hitting both voice and data for some customers, but doesn't show how far-reaching the impact is. It's clear it's quite wide; scroll down and read the comments below.</p><p>There is no timeline for a resolution, but Verizon's engineers are working on it. So that's a positive.</p><h3 id="it-s-a-good-time-to-try-messages-via-satellite-on-your-iphone-2">It's a good time to try Messages via Satellite on your iPhone</h3><p>If you see "SOS" on your iPhone 14 or newer, now is a good time to try "Messages via Satellite." Apple originally designed this for when you're out in the wilderness or a place that's intended to have no cellular reception, but it's a good way to stay in contact with family and friends during a network outage.</p><p>You can see our guide to using Messages via Satellite here.</p>                    <div class= "tiktok-wrapper" style="min-height: 750px;"><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@techradar/video/7595281056165563670" data-video-id="7595281056165563670" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;">                        <section>                            @techradar                            <p></p>♬ original sound - TechRadar</section>                    </blockquote></div>                <h3 id="verizon-s-responding-back-to-frustrated-users-on-social-media-2">Verizon's responding back to frustrated users on social media</h3><p>While we still haven't seen a formal Tweet from the @Verizon account, the @VerizonSupport account is responding to individual customers who are tweeting about network connectivity issues. And it appears to be the same message to most folks, likely automated and asking for a DM to help troubleshoot the issue.</p><h3 id="other-carriers-are-spiking-on-down-detector-but-it-s-likely-not-another-outage-2">Other carriers are spiking on Down Detector, but it's likely not another outage</h3><p>As we see with almost all service outages, competing services tend to spike when one carrier is experiencing one. With mobile carriers, it's generally the case that one person has Verizon and is in the midst of the outage, and they're reaching out to someone at AT&T, T-Mobile, or another carrier; if they don't, they fail to do so.</p><p>Generally, it's that Verizon can't connect to that network, not that AT&T or T-Mobile is simultaneously experiencing another outage, though it's possible.</p><h3 id="a-look-at-messages-via-satellite-on-iphone-2">A look at 'Messages via Satellite' on iPhone</h3><p>While I'm still seeing service on Visible – Verizon's own MVNO – with 5G UW, my colleague, Lance Ulanoff, on Verizon proper, is still seeing SOS and is attempting to use 'Messages via Satellite' on his iPhone 17 Pro Max. Here's what that looks like: it's a pretty nice visual interface that takes over the Dynamic Island.</p><h3 id="down-detector-reports-are-dropping-but-many-are-still-reporting-issues-2">Down Detector reports are dropping, but many are still reporting issues</h3><p>Let's take a quick status check on Down Detector – while reported issues with Verizon were at nearly 180,000, it is starting to drop to around 120,000. A significant drop, which might point to some recovery, but also still way above the number we expect Verizon or any cellular carrier to be at on a normal day.</p><p>Lance headed onto the streets of NYC to give 'Messages via Satellite' a go, as his iPhone 17 Pro Max in Cosmic Orange that's connected to Verizon is still showing SOS. He connected via satellite, following the prompts, but the four messages he sent me still haven't been received on my end.</p><h3 id="verizon-s-outage-is-impacting-voice-text-and-data-for-cellular-customers-2">Verizon's outage is impacting voice, text, and data for cellular customers</h3><p>Here's a quick update – reported outages for Verizon began spiking a bit before 12:30 PM ET on January 24, 2026, and Verizon confirmed the issue shortly after 1 PM ET. The outage is affecting nearly all parts of Verizon's cellular service in the areas covered, including New York, New Jersey, the Carolinas, Texas, and Florida, among others. Just look at the comments below.</p><p>Additionally, it affects voice, text, and data, with many affected phones displaying an SOS icon instead of the usual network bars and 5G/5G UW/4G in the top corner. For iPhone users with a 14 or newer model, you'll be directed to satellite services, including 'Messages via Satellite'.</p><h3 id="verizon-s-provided-an-update-but-there-s-still-no-estimate-for-a-fix-2">Verizon's provided an update, but there's still no estimate for a fix</h3><p>Verizon just shared another update via @VerizonNews on X. As expected, its engineering team is still investigating the issue and working to resolve it, but there is no estimate yet for when recovery will occur.</p><p>And further, Verizon's not sharing any information on what's causing the issue – we've reached back out to Verizon to ask for more information, though we might not hear back until this is resolved.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Verizon engineering teams are continuing to address today's service interruptions. Our teams remain fully deployed and are focused on the issue. We understand the impact this has on your day and remain committed to resolving this as quickly as possible.January 14, 2026</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h3 id="let-s-talk-about-those-network-bars-2">Let's talk about those network bars</h3><p>If you see bars but are unable to make a call or receive data, remember that those bars simply indicate a connection to a cell tower. In that case, you're in range, and it's still casting, but it's similar to a home Wi-Fi network that is casting without a direct pipeline to the World Wide Web.</p><p>In this case, as Verizon works to restore its network and resolve the issue, you may be able to reach a cell tower and have a strong signal, but it's not sending any data or voice traffic back to you. Meaning that you won't be able to use the internet, or at least use it at close to normal speeds, make calls, or send a message.</p><p>It's also likely that when Verizon is unaware that recovery is underway, a full restoration will take longer and can vary by location. Of course, there's a chance you don't even see those network bars as of right now, as many are seeing those swapped for SOS.</p><p>New York City's official emergency notification system has commented on the situation, noting that if you're on Verizon and are impacted by this outage, it may affect your ability to dial 911 in an emergency. It advises you to try calling from a landline or another device, or to visit a precinct, if you have an emergency.</p><p>You can also try using 'Emergency SOS via Satellite' if you're an iPhone 14 or newer.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nationwide @Verizon Wireless Outage: Outage may affect some users trying to call 911. Call using a device from another carrier, a landline, or go to a police/fire station to report emergencies. To find your precinct: https://t.co/QtknvNamrXJanuary 14, 2026</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We have a slight update, at least from folks on Verizon, but it's not a fix, more like a glimmer of recovery.</p><p>Here in NYC, my colleague Lance Ulanoff is now seeing two bars of service and 5G after a restart on his iPhone 17 Pro Max, which is connected to Verizon. Though it's super spotty and has quickly gone back to SOS, meanwhile, other colleagues are still seeing SOS and not even seeing the network bars after a restart.</p><p>So, fair to say that Verizon's network is still impacted, and we're waiting on further updates from the carrier on what's causing the outage and when recovery might be. Judging from the comments below, though, it appears many are seeing it come back, then disappear back to SOS or no bars.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span></div></div></div><p>As we noted earlier, other carriers are operating normally, with T-Mobile posting on X (formerly Twitter) that its network is performing well. It does note that if you're attempting to reach someone on Verizon, you may not be able to establish the connection.</p><p>We're still waiting for an update from Verizon as well on the current network issues.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">T-Mobile’s network is keeping our customers connected, and we’ve confirmed that our network is operating normally and as expected. However due to Verizon’s reported outage, our customers may not be able to reach someone with Verizon service at this time.January 14, 2026</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Just like T-Mobile, AT&T is also confirming that its network is operating just fine ... albeit with a bit more sass.</p><p>The carrier writes, "Our network? Solid." and then notes that if you're having issues, it's due to another network but doesn't mention Verizon by name. AT&T then shouts out some switching offers as well.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our network? Solid. If you’re experiencing issues, it’s not us.....it’s the other guys. Some things are just out of our hands! - BUT if you're interested in giving us a try - https://t.co/xftQXpUcjwJanuary 14, 2026</p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h3 id="verizon-is-finally-showing-some-proof-of-life-in-nyc-2">Verizon is finally showing some proof of life in NYC</h3><p>We won't call this a full recovery just yet, but my colleague Lance Ulanoff is now seeing three bars and 5G UW. His first call to me failed, and it showed 'Call Failed' on the iPhone, but on the second attempt, after a brief delay, I was able to hear him, and he was able to hear me.</p><p>I also had him run a quick speed test, and on Verizon 5G UW from a 17 Pro Max, he got 19.8 Mbps download and 5.97 Mbps upload. So this is progress, but we're not sure how widespread the recovery is. Let us know if service is starting to come back in the comments below.</p><p>Of course, we'll update you if this disappears again or if we get another comment from Verizon.</p><p>Quick update – Lance's phone quickly went back to SOS and then back to a few bars, so it's likely that Verizon is working on restorations and that there is a flood of iPhones and other phones like Pixel and Galaxy devices trying to get back online.</p><p>We're keen to hear Verizon provide another update on what exactly is going on, as the last one was at 2:14 PM ET – over an hour ago.</p><p>We reached out to Carolina Milanesi, President and Principal Analyst at Creative Strategies, Inc., for her thoughts and expertise on the current outage impacting Verizon:</p><p>"Sadly, we are getting accustomed to outages, whether they are network Verizon today, ATT in 2024, AWS at the end of 2025, and I fear this is the new reality as cyber attacks increase and reliance on major cloud and AI providers increases," wrote Milanesi.</p><p>While there is no evidence that today's issues are a cyberattack, such outages are certainly on the rise. One thing that I'd hope we see improved is communication from the impacted services, but that's not the case yet ... with Verizon today, Verizon in 2024, or the outages in between.</p><p>And here's the latest look at the reported outage map from Down Detector – Verizon's outage is very widespread, hitting the East Coast – Northeast and Southeast – Midwest, and even select metropolitan cities on the West Coast.</p><h3 id="here-s-where-we-stand-4-hours-in-2">Here's where we stand 4 hours in</h3><p>This is officially the biggest and longest outage of 2026, but I'll level with you, it's also the first outage of 2026. Even so, this will stand as a major outage for Verizon, disrupting cell service for countless customers, and it's still ongoing.</p><p>Verizon's latest update on the outage came at 2:14 PM ET, close to two hours ago, and it didn't provide much of a real needle pusher. It noted that the engineering team is focusing on addressing the interruption and is fully committed to resolving it. No mention of what's causing it or the estimated time for resolution.</p><p>We've reached out to Verizon to ask for more information and are waiting to hear back; that'll likely be the case until another wide statement is issued. For now, though, if you have Verizon, your ability to make calls, send texts, and use data – aka browse the web on 5G or even 4G – is likely affected. If you're on an iPhone, you're likely seeing network bars replaced with SOS. You can see our guide to sending messages via satellite here.</p><p>Keep posting in the comments below to let us know if your service is still out, if it's showing signs of coming back to life, or if it's being a bit of a tease like my colleagues have been seeing. For what it's worth, I still have two bars and 5G on Visible, but Lance is seeing Verizon with no bars and no mention of 5G with no connectivity.</p><h3 id="krispy-kreme-to-the-rescue-sort-of-2">Krispy Kreme to the rescue, sort of</h3><p>While it's not a service recovery, Krispy Kreme is at least making those impacted by Verizon's major outage today feel a little bit better. The iconic doughnut chain has confirmed to TechRadar that it'll be serving up free original glazed doughnuts from 5 PM to 7 PM across the United States at its locations as a 'sweet backup plan.'</p><p>That's pretty great, and I can confirm a Krispy Kreme original glazed can really hit the spot. If only Verizon would provide another update!</p><h3 id="verizon-provides-an-update-but-still-no-time-for-a-resolution-2">Verizon provides an update, but still no time for a resolution</h3><p>Well, Verizon's finally shared another update on the ongoing network disruption as of 4:12PM ET. It doesn't state the cause of the issue or how long it'll take for it be resolved, but it does read, "Verizon's team is on the ground actively working to fix today’s service issue that is impacting some customers."</p><p>Verizon's clearly working fast to resolve the issue, but as of now many, many customers are still without connectivity. We'll keep you updated!</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Verizon's team is on the ground actively working to fix today’s service issue that is impacting some customers.
