<p>Over the past decade, software development has been shaped by two closely related transformations. One is the rise of devops and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which brought development and operations teams together around automated, incremental software delivery.</p>



<p>The other is the shift from monolithic applications to distributed, cloud-native systems built from microservices and containers, typically managed by orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes.</p>



<p>While Kubernetes and similar platforms simplify many aspects of running distributed applications, operating these systems at scale is still complicated. Configuration sprawl, environment drift, and the need for rapid, reliable change all introduce operational challenges. GitOps emerged as a way to address those challenges by extending familiar devops and CI/CD techniques beyond application code and into infrastructure and system configuration.</p>



<p>At the heart of GitOps is the concept of infrastructure as code (IaC). In a GitOps model, not only application code but also infrastructure definitions, deployment configurations, and operational settings are described in files stored in a version control system. Automated processes continuously compare the running system with those declarations and work to bring the live environment back into alignment when differences appear.</p>



<p>In this approach, the version control repository serves as the system of record for how applications and their supporting infrastructure should look in production. Changes flow through the same review, approval, and automation pipelines that developers already use for software, bringing greater consistency, traceability, and repeatability to cloud-native operations.</p>



<p>At a high level, GitOps refers to a set of operational practices for managing cloud-native systems using declarative configuration, version control, and automated reconciliation. Rather than treating infrastructure and application configuration as mutable runtime state, GitOps treats them as versioned artifacts that move through the same review, testing, and deployment processes as application code.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GitOps defined</strong></h3>



<p>The term GitOps was originally coined and popularized by Weaveworks, which helped formalize the approach in the context of Kubernetes operations. While that early work shaped the way GitOps was discussed and implemented, GitOps has since evolved into a broadly adopted, vendor-neutral pattern. Today, it describes a shared set of ideas rather than a specific product or platform.</p>



<p>The defining characteristic of GitOps is its reliance on declarative configuration stored in a version control system. Instead of issuing imperative commands to change live systems, teams describe the desired state of applications and infrastructure in configuration files. Automated agents then continuously compare that declared state with what is actually running and work to reconcile any differences. This pull-based model—where systems converge toward the desired state defined in version control—provides built-in drift detection, repeatability, and a clear audit trail for every change.</p>



<p>Because GitOps centers on configuration files stored in a version control system, familiar software development practices carry over naturally. Changes are proposed through commits, reviewed before being accepted, and tracked over time. Rollbacks are accomplished by reverting to known-good versions, and the history of how a system evolved is preserved alongside the configuration itself.</p>



<p>While the use of Git as the version control system is not strictly required, it has become the default choice because of its ubiquity in modern devops workflows and its strong support for collaboration and change management, so its place in the name has stuck.</p>



<aside class="sidebar">
<h3><strong> GitOps vs. IaC </strong></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Infrastructure as code (IaC) and GitOps are closely related, but they solve different problems. </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">IaC focuses on how infrastructure is defined. Servers, networks, and services are described using declarative configuration files, which are then applied by automation tools. GitOps builds on IaC by adding an operating model around those definitions. In a GitOps workflow, the desired state of systems is stored in a version control repository and treated as the system of record. Automated agents continuously compare the running environment with that desired state and reconcile any differences.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The key distinction is persistence. IaC provisions infrastructure; GitOps keeps systems in the intended state over time. By using pull-based reconciliation and continuous drift detection, GitOps extends IaC into a day-to-day operational discipline.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the CI/CD process?</strong></h3>



<p>A complete look at CI/CD is beyond the scope of this article—see the InfoWorld explainer on the subject—but we need to say a few words about CI/CD because it’s at the core of how GitOps works. The <em>continuous integration</em> half of CI/CD is enabled by version control repositories like Git: Developers can make constant small improvements to their codebase, rather than rolling out huge, monolithic new versions every few months or years. The <em>continuous deployment</em> piece is made possible by automated systems called <em>pipelines</em> that build, test, and deploy the new code to production.</p>



<p>Again, we keep talking about <em>code </em>here, and that usually summons up visions of executable code written in a programming language such as C or Java or JavaScript. But in GitOps, the “code” we’re managing is largely made up of configuration files. This isn’t just a minor detail — it’s at the heart of what GitOps does. These config files are, as we’ve said, the “single source of truth” describing what our system should look like. They are <em>declarative </em>rather than instructive. That means that instead of saying “start up ten servers,” the configuration file will simply say, “this system includes ten servers.”</p>



<p><strong>GitOps and Kubernetes</strong></p>



<p>GitOps first took hold in the Kubernetes ecosystem, where declarative configuration and continuous reconciliation are core design principles. As a result, Kubernetes remains the most common and best-understood environment for applying GitOps practices. A typical GitOps-driven update process for a Kubernetes application looks like this:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>A developer proposes a change by committing updated application code or configuration to a version control repository, usually through a pull request.</li>



<li>That change is reviewed and approved, then merged into the main branch.</li>



<li>The merge triggers an automated CI/CD pipeline that tests the change, builds new artifacts if needed, and publishes them to a registry.</li>



<li>A GitOps controller or similar automated agent detects the updated desired state stored in version control.</li>



<li>The controller compares that desired state with the current state of the Kubernetes cluster and applies the necessary changes to bring the cluster back into alignment.</li>
</ol>



<p>This pull-based reconciliation loop—where the cluster continuously converges toward the desired state defined in version control—is central to how GitOps works in practice. While Kubernetes provides a natural fit for this model, it represents just one canonical use case. The same patterns increasingly apply to infrastructure provisioning, policy enforcement, and multi-cluster operations beyond Kubernetes itself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GitOps tooling in practice: Argo CD, Flux, and the ecosystem</strong></h3>



<p>GitOps is enabled by a set of tools that embody the principles we’ve outlined, with some open-source projects emerging as de facto standards in cloud-native environments.</p>



<p>At the center of the GitOps ecosystem is Argo CD, an open-source controller that continuously monitors a version control repository and ensures that the state of running systems matches the declared desired state. Argo CD is widely used in Kubernetes environments because it directly implements pull-based reconciliation: it compares the desired state stored in Git with the cluster’s actual state and applies changes to correct any drift.</p>



<p>Alongside Argo CD, Flux is another prominent open source GitOps engine. Both Flux and Argo CD help teams adopt GitOps workflows by managing the synchronization loop between code and runtime, but they differ in operational philosophy, integration surfaces, and ecosystem fit.</p>



<p>GitOps tooling often appears as part of broader platforms or integrated stacks rather than as isolated utilities. For example, multicloud and cluster management solutions now routinely include GitOps support, with Argo CD or compatible controllers bundled alongside deployment, policy, and governance capabilities.</p>



<p>In addition to Flux and Argo CD, a range of auxiliary tools contribute to a complete GitOps ecosystem: policy as code engines (e.g., Open Policy Agent), drift detection systems, and infrastructure provisioning tools that mesh with Git-centric workflows.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GitOps, devops, and normalization</strong></h3>



<p>GitOps grew out of the same forces that drove devops into mainstream IT practice, and in its early days, GitOps was often discussed as a distinct extension of devops, specifically tailored to managing declarative infrastructure and Kubernetes-centric systems. At the time, GitOps was still relatively new and not yet widely adopted outside cloud-native pioneers.</p>



<p>Over the last several years, however, GitOps practices have become deeply woven into how teams operate modern cloud environments. Rather than being treated as an optional add-on or marketing term, the core ideas of GitOps — using version-controlled, declarative configuration and automated reconciliation loops to continuously align running systems with intended state — are now part of standard operational practice in many Kubernetes-centric shops. In this sense, GitOps has shifted from a buzzword about what might be possible to a baseline pattern for cloud-native operations, much like devops itself did years earlier.</p>



<p>In environments where Kubernetes and declarative systems are the norm, GitOps workflows are the default way teams manage and deploy change. Many organizations now implement these patterns without explicitly calling them “GitOps,” just as few teams today explicitly say they do “CI/CD” even though continuous pipelines are taken for granted. The term has become less prominent in marketing, but its practices are often embedded in pipelines, controllers, and platform tooling.</p>



<p>That normalization shows up in how GitOps workflows are woven into broader operational frameworks. For example, platform engineering teams frequently build internal developer platforms that encapsulate GitOps patterns behind standardized developer APIs, making the pattern invisible to most application teams while still providing the auditability and automation that GitOps promises.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GitOps beyond Kubernetes: infrastructure, policy, and drift</strong></h3>



<p>While GitOps first gained traction as a way to manage Kubernetes deployments, its core principles apply broadly to infrastructure and operational concerns beyond any single orchestration platform. GitOps treats desired state as declarative configuration stored in version control and uses automated reconciliation to ensure running systems align with that state. That pattern naturally extends to infrastructure provisioning, policy enforcement, configuration drift detection, and governance workflows across diverse environments.</p>



<p>In modern operational stacks, infrastructure is increasingly defined declaratively, whether through Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, or other infrastructure-as-code formats. Storing these declarations in version control enables the same peer-review, auditability, and rollback practices developers already use for application code. Automated tooling then continuously detects when the live infrastructure diverges from the declared state and works to bring it back into alignment, reducing the risk of configuration drift and inadvertent misconfigurations.</p>



<p>Configuration drift — the state where an environment has diverged from what’s declared in version control — remains a major operational headache, especially in complex, dynamic systems. Drift can arise from ad hoc fixes, emergency updates, or manual changes made outside normal pipelines, and it can lead to inconsistencies, outages, and security gaps. By continually checking running systems against the desired state in Git and reconciling deviations automatically, GitOps workflows help teams keep environments predictable and auditable.</p>



<p>Policy enforcement and compliance are another natural extension of GitOps patterns. As organizations adopt declarative practices, policy-as-code engines and drift detection systems can be woven into GitOps pipelines to validate that proposed configurations meet security, compliance, or operational standards before they’re ever applied to running systems. Embedding policy checks into declarative workflows brings consistency to governance while preserving the automation and speed that devops teams expect.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GitOps – beyond Kubernetes</strong></h3>



<p>GitOps began as a way to bring devops discipline to Kubernetes operations, but its longer-term impact has been more subtle. In many ways, it’s been absorbed into the fabric of modern cloud-native operations, where declarative configuration, version control, and automated reconciliation are taken for granted. Today, GitOps is less about a specific set of tools or a named practice and more about an operational mindset. By treating infrastructure and configuration as versioned, auditable artifacts and relying on automation to enforce consistency, GitOps helps teams manage complexity at scale. Even as the term itself fades from the spotlight, the practices it introduced continue to shape how distributed systems are built, deployed, and operated.</p>
