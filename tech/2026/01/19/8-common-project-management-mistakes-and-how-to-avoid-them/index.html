<p>Project managers are doing exactly what they were taught to do. They build plans, chase team members for updates, and report status. Despite all the activity, your leadership team is wondering why projects take so long and cost so much.</p>



<p>When projects don’t seem to move fast enough or deliver the ROI you expected, it usually has less to do with effort and more with a set of common mistakes your project managers make because of how they were trained, and what that training left out. Most project teams operate like order takers instead of the business-focused leaders you need to deliver your organization’s strategy.</p>



<p>To accelerate strategy delivery in your organization, something has to change. The way projects are led needs to shift, and traditional project management approaches and mindsets won’t get you there.</p>



<p>Here are the most common project management mistakes we see holding teams back, and what you can do to help your project leaders shift from being order takers to drivers of IMPACT: instilling focus, measuring outcomes, performing, adapting, communicating, and transforming.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistake-1-solving-project-problems-instead-of-business-problems">Mistake #1: Solving project problems instead of business problems</h3>



<p>Project managers are trained to solve project problems. Scope creep. Missed deadlines. Resource bottlenecks. They spend their days managing tasks and chasing status updates, but most of them have no idea whether the work they manage is solving a real business problem.</p>



<p>That’s not their fault. They’ve been taught to stay in their lane in formal training and by many executives. Keep the project moving. Don’t ask questions. Focus on delivery.</p>



<p>But no one is talking to them about the purpose of these projects and what success looks like from a business perspective, so how can they help you achieve it?</p>



<p>You don’t need another project checked off the list. You need the business problem solved.</p>



<p><strong>IMPACT driver mindset: Instill focus</strong></p>



<p>Start by helping your teams understand the business context behind the work. What problem are we trying to solve? Why does this project matter to the organization? What outcome are we aiming for?</p>



<p>Your teams can’t answer those questions unless you bring them into the strategy conversation. When they understand the business goals, not just the project goals, they can start making decisions differently. Their conversations change to ensure everyone knows why their work matters. The entire team begins choosing priorities, tradeoffs, and solutions that are aligned with solving that business problem instead of just checking tasks off the list.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistake-2-tracking-progress-instead-of-measuring-business-value">Mistake #2: Tracking progress instead of measuring business value</h3>



<p>Your teams are taught to track progress toward delivering outputs. On time, on scope, and on budget are the metrics they hear repeatedly. But those metrics only tell you if deliverables will be created as planned, not if that work will deliver the results the business expects.</p>



<p>Most project managers are taught to measure how busy the team is. Everyone walks around wearing their busy badge of honor as if that proves value. They give updates about what’s done, what’s in progress, and what’s late. But the metrics they use show how busy everyone is at creating outputs, not how they’re tracking toward achieving outcomes.</p>



<p>All of that busyness can look impressive on paper, but it’s not the same as being productive. In fact, busy gets in the way of being productive.</p>



<p><strong>IMPACT driver mindset: Measure outcomes</strong></p>



<p>Now that the team understands what they’re doing and why, the next question to answer is how will we know we’re successful.</p>



<p>Right from the start of the project, you need to define not just the business goal but how you’ll measure it was successful in business terms. Did the project reduce cost, increase revenue, improve the customer experience? That’s what you and your peers care about, but often that’s not the focus you ask the project people to drive toward.</p>



<p>Think about a project that’s intended to drive revenue but ends up costing you twice as much to deliver. If the revenue target stays the same, the project may no longer make sense. Or they might come up with a way to drive even higher revenue because they understood the way you measure success.</p>



<p>Shift how you measure project success from outputs to outcomes and watch how quickly your projects start creating real business value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistake-3-perfecting-process-instead-of-streamlining-it">Mistake #3: Perfecting process instead of streamlining it</h3>



<p>If your teams spend more time tweaking templates, building frameworks, or debating methodology than actually delivering results, processes become inefficient.</p>



<p>Often project managers are hired for their certifications, which leads many of them to believe their value is tied to how much of and how perfectly they create and follow that process. They work hard to make sure every box is checked, every template is filled out, and every report is delivered on time. But if the process becomes the goal, they’re missing the point.</p>



<p>You invested in project management to get business results, not build a deliverable machine, and the faster you achieve those results, the higher your return on your project investments.</p>



<p><strong>IMPACT driver mindset: Perform relentlessly</strong></p>



<p>With a clear plan to drive business value, now we need to show them how to accelerate. That means relentlessly evaluating, streamlining, and optimizing the delivery process so it helps the team achieve the project goals faster.</p>



<p>Give them permission to simplify. When the process slows them down or adds work that doesn’t add value, they should be able to call it out.</p>



<p>This isn’t an excuse to have no process or claim you’re being agile just to skip the necessary steps. It’s about right-sizing the process, simplifying where you can, and being thoughtful about what’s truly needed to deliver the outcome. Do you really need a 30-page document no one will read, or would two pages that people actually use be enough? You don’t need perfection. You need progress.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistake-4-blaming-people-instead-of-leading-them-through-change">Mistake #4: Blaming people instead of leading them through change</h3>



<p>A lot of leaders start from the belief that people are naturally resistant to change. When projects stall or results fall short, it’s easy to assume someone just didn’t want to change. Project teams blame people, then layer on more governance, more process, and more pressure. Most of the time, it’s not a people problem. It’s how the changes are being done to people instead of with them.</p>



<p>People don’t resist because they’re lazy or difficult. They resist because they don’t understand why it’s happening or what it means for them. And no amount of process will fix that.</p>



<p><strong>IMPACT driver mindset: Adapt to thrive</strong></p>



<p>With an accelerated delivery plan designed to drive business value, your project teams can now turn their attention to bringing people with them through the change process.</p>



<p>Change management is everyone’s job, not something you outsource to HR or a change team. Projects fail without good change management and everyone needs to be involved. Your teams must understand that people aren’t resistant to change. They’re resistant to having change done to them. You have to teach them how to bring others through the change process instead of pushing change at them.</p>



<p>Teach your project teams how to engage stakeholders early and often so they feel part of the change journey. When people are included, feel heard, and involved in shaping the solution, resistance starts to fade and you create a united force that supports your accelerated delivery plan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistake-5-communicating-for-compliance-instead-of-engagement">Mistake #5: Communicating for compliance instead of engagement</h3>



<p>The reason most project communication fails is because it’s treated like a one-way path. Status reports people don’t understand. Steering committee slides read to a room full of executives who aren’t engaged. Unread emails. The information goes out because it’s required, not because it’s helping people make better decisions or take the right action.</p>



<p>But that kind of communication doesn’t create clarity, build engagement, or drive alignment. And it doesn’t inspire anyone to lean in and help solve the real problems.</p>



<p><strong>IMPACT driver mindset: Communicate with purpose</strong></p>



<p>To keep people engaged in the project and help it keep accelerating toward business goals, you need purpose-driven communication designed to drive actions and decisions. Your teams shouldn’t just push information but enable action. That means getting the right people and the right message at the right time, with a clear next step.</p>



<p>If you want your projects to move faster, communication can’t be a formality. When teams, sponsors, and stakeholders know what’s happening and why it matters, they make decisions faster. You don’t need more status reports. You need communication that drives actions and decisions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistake-6-driving-project-goals-instead-of-business-outcomes">Mistake #6: Driving project goals instead of business outcomes</h3>



<p>Most organizations still define the project leadership role around task-focused delivery. Get the project done. Hit the date. Stay on budget. Project managers have been trained to believe that finishing the project as planned is the definition of success. But that’s not how you define project success.</p>



<p>If you keep project managers out of the conversations about strategy and business goals, they’ll naturally focus on project outputs instead of business outcomes. This leaves you in the same place you are today. Projects are completed, outputs are delivered, but the business doesn’t always see the impact expected.</p>



<p><strong>IMPACT driver mindset: Transform mindset</strong></p>



<p>When you help your teams instill focus, measure outcomes, perform relentlessly, adapt to thrive, and communicate with purpose, you do more than improve project delivery. You build the foundation for a different kind of leadership.</p>



<p>Shift how you and your organization see the project leadership role. Your project managers are no longer just running projects. You’re developing strategy navigators who partner with you to guide how strategy gets delivered, and help you see around corners, connect initiatives, and decide where to invest next.</p>



<p>When project managers are trusted to think this way and given visibility into the strategy, they learn how the business really works. They stop chasing project success and start driving business success.</p>
