<p><em>Interview transcript:</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>There&#8217;s a lot to talk about, but it strikes me as strange that here we are two weeks before all of the continuing resolutions expire. The Senate is out this week. The House is planning to be out next week. Are they going to finish in time?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>There&#8217;s a path for them to do so and unlike other deadlines, when they&#8217;re approaching, everyone&#8217;s hair on fire — we haven&#8217;t felt that dynamic on this one. The House and Senate appropriators, they&#8217;re reaching deals, releasing packages, processing them through the House in the Senate, and there&#8217;s a way to get this all done by Jan. 30, or if they need a week or something, appropriators are already saying we could do another short-term. But there&#8217;s not a panic about this deadline that&#8217;s only two weeks away or so.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>Well, let&#8217;s recap, which bills are through and who would you say are the big winners in those bills?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>So we had the three bills go through last year. We&#8217;ve had another three-bill package get through both chambers this year. The House sent another two-bill package over to the Senate, who can deal with that when they come back. And then there&#8217;s this four-bill package, the remaining outstanding ones that they still need to tackle and get through both chambers. So there&#8217;s a lot of progress there. The last one&#8217;s big — Defense, Labor, HHS — and thorny in the case of the Homeland Security Department, given everything that&#8217;s going on there with ICE in Minnesota and concerns about lawmaker oversight there.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>Well, Homeland and Defense both got big chunks of money in the summer that they&#8217;re continuing to operate. So does it feel like maybe there&#8217;s a little less urgency around those bills?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>A little less urgency on the Defense side, where I think if you put that together with the reconciliation bill, it&#8217;s like $1 trillion. Of course, the president wants to take that to $1.5 trillion next year. We can deal with that another time. And Homeland, that extra pool of money has helped. They&#8217;ve used that to hire staff, to open centers. But there was a little controversy because DHS said if an ICE facility is funded with the reconciliation dollars, some of the oversight is different there than if it was regular appropriations. So we&#8217;ve seen a distinction made there. But definitely having that money earlier, locking that in for the administration, was really key to their plans for the year.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>What are the big controversies that are still on the table that are going to have to be hashed out before that last bill package gets through?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>DHS has been the sticking point. That was initially supposed to be in the last package; it ended up only being two bills instead of three as they worked through some of these discussions. And you could see a deal being made there and getting that through, maybe both chambers. But there could be a fight on that one in either chamber, depending on what you need. What we have seen are very bipartisan packages where the votes have been widespread, some opposition obviously, but they&#8217;ve gotten through very comfortably after all the fights that we went through ahead of this point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>It does also seem, at least on the bills that have gotten through so far, that Congress has largely rejected the cuts that the administration proposed for 50% reductions are higher. Most of the reductions are very minor. So since agencies have already been downsized in many cases, what does this mean? How will relative increases, I guess, compared to where they&#8217;re operating today — how will that come into effect?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>In some cases, it&#8217;s less than they had last year, but still more than the administration wanted and more than House Republicans wanted in their initial versions. So we&#8217;re seeing a classic compromise being hashed out here between the House and the Senate, enough money for Democrats to support these bills, not the drastic cuts. And they&#8217;ve hastened to say &#8220;no poison pills&#8221; when they&#8217;ve released these different packages. But we&#8217;ll see how the agencies respond to more money. That&#8217;s been a fight over the course of the administration, where they&#8217;ve wanted to impound funds, rescind them, but if you put them back out there the agencies can use them. And even something like foreign aid is going to the State Department now, rather than USAID, after USAID was disestablished by the administration.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>I&#8217;m speaking with Loren Duggan. He&#8217;s deputy news director for Bloomberg Government. Loren, outside of the appropriations, what other sorts of legislative discussions are taking place on the Hill these days? ACA subsidies still on top?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>ACA subsidies has been a big driver of discussion. We are now at the end of open enrollment without an answer to what to do with these credits, if they&#8217;ll be extended. I assume the senators are still talking this week and when they come back. Donald Trump&#8217;s proposal last week didn&#8217;t necessarily change the dynamic too much. But one thing that might: We&#8217;re going to see insurance company executives brought to the Hill before two different House committees this week. They&#8217;ll have to answer some tough questions. Probably get a little beaten up by both sides in this case, because both parties have some concerns with them. So we&#8217;ll see how that plays out. The ACA, that&#8217;s now a deadline that&#8217;s passed; they&#8217;re still trying to figure out how to resolve that debate.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>There was also a lot of news last week about the crypto bill in the Senate. Tell us what&#8217;s going on there.</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>There were markups that had been scheduled in two committees, and then they got pulled back as they continue to work through the issues and deal with the industry feedback. I think it was the Coinbase CEO who was up there weighing in pretty directly with lawmakers. So they pulled back, didn&#8217;t move forward, and they&#8217;re going to recalibrate the bill. This is the market structure bill, not to be confused with the stablecoin legislation, which is part of the crypto universe. This is a broader market structure bill, who has regulatory authority. I assume they&#8217;ll rejoin that debate when they return next week, if they&#8217;re not working up while they&#8217;re gone. But there&#8217;s big interest, big money, big stakes in this legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>All of the things we&#8217;ve talked about so far are sort of normal order: appropriations bills, although late, getting through other sorts of legislative activities. Let&#8217;s talk about Greenland for a minute, because it seems like it has the potential to really upend all kinds of conversations and agreements that are going on. President Trump made tariff threats over the weekend. We have a congressional delegation on the ground in Denmark. What does this all mean when it comes back to domestic politics?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>We&#8217;ll have to see, there hasn&#8217;t been a ground swell against this. There are some members of Congress who concede it might be a good idea if Greenland was part of the United States, given its geostrategic importance. But then there&#8217;s other members of Congress who have said, maybe we&#8217;ll have to impeach Trump if he goes too far on this, so there&#8217;s not a consensus. There&#8217;s definitely a lot of range of opinions on this one. And it&#8217;s something that Donald Trump&#8217;s going to hear directly from other world leaders when he goes to Davos, Switzerland, this week and he&#8217;ll be side-by-side with some of the people who he&#8217;s threatened to tariff or have strong opinions on this, given their proximity to Denmark.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>We usually focus here on domestic politics, but this seems like it will flow over into lots of conversations. What are you expecting to hear out of Davos as that conversation gets started?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>Well, we had expected a domestic announcement with the president talking about his home ownership plan, maybe taking money from 401(k)s to make a down payment, part of his broader affordability discussion, home ownership discussion. So that&#8217;s a domestic thing, but we&#8217;re definitely going to hear the global things. Not just Greenland, but his &#8220;Board of Peace&#8221; that he&#8217;s talked about, where he wants world leaders to chip in money and be part of this arrangement. I&#8217;m sure those discussions will continue and there&#8217;ll be lots of feedback, given the compact nature of Davos and everyone who will be there. There&#8217;s a little bit of domestic, but it&#8217;s more of a foreign play given who&#8217;s there. It is the World Economic Forum after all, and the world will be there and talking to Donald Trump directly.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Gerton </strong>When everybody gets back, what will you be watching for on the Hill?</p>
<p><strong>Loren Duggan </strong>We&#8217;ll see if they can wrap up the spending debate and then they&#8217;ll be turning to February and eventually the fiscal &#8217;27 process is right there. We&#8217;ll just get done with this one and really have to turn the page pretty quickly.</p></blockquote><p>The post Crypto overhaul, Greenland, ACA subsidies, spending bills: Lawmakers’ January juggling acts first appeared on Federal News Network.</p>
