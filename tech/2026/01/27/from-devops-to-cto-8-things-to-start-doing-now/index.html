<p>I was promoted to CTO in my late twenties, and while it is common to see young CTOs leading startups these days, it was unusual in the ‘90s. I was far less experienced back then, and still developing my business acumen. While I was a strong software developer, it wasn’t my architecture and coding skills that helped me transition to a C-level role.</p>



<p>Of all the technical skills I had back then, my devops skills were the most critical. Of course, we didn’t call it <em>devops</em>, as the term hadn’t been invented yet. We didn’t yet have CI/CD pipelines or infrastructure-as-code capabilities. Nonetheless, I automated our builds, scripted the deployments, standardized infrastructure configurations, and monitored systems performance.</p>



<p>Developing that scaffolding enabled our development teams to focus on building and testing applications while operations managed infrastructure improvements. With automation in place and a team focused on the technology, I was able to focus on higher-level tasks such as understanding customer needs, partnering with product managers, learning marketing objectives, and learning about sales operations. When our CTO left for another opportunity, I was given the chance to step into the leadership role.</p>



<p>In my book, Digital Trailblazer, I elaborate on my journey from developer to CTO and CIO. Since the book came out, many readers have asked me for advice about how to accelerate their career trajectories. In this article, I focus on how high-potential employees in devops roles—including developers and engineers—can start making moves toward a CTO role.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="lead-ai-programs-that-deliver-business-value">Lead AI programs that deliver business value</h3>



<p>Studies show that a significant number of generative AI experiments fail to get deployed into production. According to the recent MIT State of AI in business report, 95% of organizations are getting zero return on their AI investments. Experimentation is an essential stage in the learning experience, especially when adopting new technologies and AI models. But the C-suite is pressuring IT departments to demonstrate better return on investment (ROI) from AI initiatives.</p>



<p>Devops leaders have the opportunity to make a difference in their organization and for their careers. Lead a successful AI initiative, deploy to production, deliver business value, and share best practices for other teams to follow. Successful devops leaders don’t jump on the easy opportunities; they look for the ones that can have a significant business impact.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Look for opportunities with clearly defined vision statements, active sponsors, and a dedicated team committed to the objectives. Take on the role of agile delivery leader and partner with a product manager who specifies targeted user personas, priorities, and success criteria for the AI program.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="establish-development-standards-for-using-ai-tools-effectively">Establish development standards for using AI tools effectively</h3>



<p>Another area where devops engineers can demonstrate leadership skills is by establishing standards for applying genAI tools throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Advanced tools and capabilities require effective strategies to extend best practices beyond early adopters and ensure that multiple teams succeed. Some questions to consider:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When is vibe coding a development option?</li>



<li>How should teams use AI code generators for accurate and valid results?</li>



<li>How can generative AI improve the quality of user stories and help in maintaining technical documentation?</li>



<li>Where should teams invest in test automation and observability to ensure that code changes to AI agents improve results?</li>



<li>What areas of automation, from advanced CI/CD to multicloud operations, need to be prioritized over feature development?</li>



<li>What are the devops non-negotiables and non-functional requirements to ensure resilient AI agents?</li>
</ul>



<p>“The most relevant engineers will be the ones who treat AI as a collaborator and leadership as a craft,” says Rukmini Reddy, SVP of engineering at PagerDuty. “Resolve to deepen your automation skills, but also strengthen how you communicate, mentor, and create safety across both technical systems and human processes. Resilient operations depend just as much on how teams work together as on the automation that ships our software.”</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The key for devops leaders is to first find the most effective ways to apply AI in the SDLC and operations, then take a leadership role in drafting and communicating standards that teams readily adopt.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="develop-platforms-teams-want-to-use">Develop platforms teams want to use</h3>



<p>If you want to be recognized for promotions and greater responsibilities, a place to start is in your areas of expertise and with your team, peers, and technology leaders. However, shift your focus from getting something done to a <em>practice leadership</em> mindset. Develop a practice or platform your team and colleagues want to use and demonstrate its benefits to the organization.</p>



<p>Devops engineers can position themselves for a leadership role by focusing on initiatives that deliver business value. Look to deliver small, incremental wins and guide solutions that help teams make continuous improvements in key areas.</p>



<p>Another important area of work is reviewing platform engineering approaches that improve developer experience and creating self-service solutions. Leaders seeking recognition can also help teams adopt shift-left security and improve continuous testing practices.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Don’t leave it to chance that leadership will recognize your accomplishments. Track your activities, adoption, and impacts in technology areas that deliver scalable and reusable patterns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="shift-your-mindset-to-tech-facilitator-and-planner">Shift your mindset to tech facilitator and planner</h3>



<p>One of the bigger challenges for engineers when taking on larger technical responsibilities is shifting their mindset from getting work done today to deciding what work to prioritize and influencing longer-term implementation decisions. Instead of developing immediate solutions, the path to CTO requires planning architecture, establishing governance, and influencing teams to adopt self-organizing standards.</p>



<p>Martin Davis, managing partner at Dunelm Associates, says to become a CTO, engineers must shift from tactical problem-solving to big-picture, longer-term strategic planning. He suggests the following three questions to evaluate platforms and technologies and shift to a more strategic mindset:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How will these technologies handle future expansion, both business and technology?</li>



<li>How will they adapt to changing circumstances?</li>



<li>How will they allow the addition and integration of other tools?</li>
</ul>



<p>“There are rarely right and wrong answers, and technology changes fast, so be pragmatic and be prepared to abandon previous decisions as circumstances change,” recommends Davis.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: One of the hardest mindset transitions for CTOs is shifting from being the technology expert and go-to problem-solver to becoming a leader facilitating the conversation about possible technology implementations. If you want to be a CTO, learn to take a step back to see the big picture and engage the team in recommending technology solutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="develop-data-governance-and-science-expertise">Develop data governance and science expertise</h3>



<p>Many CTOs come up the ranks as delivery leaders focused on building APIs, applications, and now AI agents. Some will have data management skills and understand architecture decisions behind data warehouses, data lakes, and data fabrics.</p>



<p>But fewer CTOs have a background in data engineering, dataops, data science, and data governance. Therein lies an opportunity for devops engineers who want to become CTOs one day: Get hands-on with the challenges faced by data specialists tasked with building governed data products, which are typically composed of reusable data assets that serve multiple business needs.</p>



<p>A good area to dive into is improving data quality and ensuring data is AI-ready. It’s an underappreciated function that’s key to building accurate data products and AI agents.</p>



<p>Camden Swita, head of AI and ML at New Relic, says to prioritize understanding how your datasets can be used by an AI system and sussing out poor data quality. “It’s one thing for a human to recognize poor data and work around it, but AI agents are still not great at it, and using poor or outdated data will lead to undesirable outcomes. Cleaning and improving data will help address common issues like hallucinations, bad recommendations, and other issues,” says Swita.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Devops engineers have many opportunities to deepen their knowledge and skills in data practices. Consider getting involved in answering some of these 10 data management questions around building trust, monitoring AI models, and improving data lineage. Also, review the 6 data risks CIOs and business leaders should be paranoid about, including intellectual property and third-party data sources.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="extend-your-technology-expertise-across-disciplines">Extend your technology expertise across disciplines</h3>



<p>To ascend to a leadership role, gaining expertise in a handful of practices and technologies is insufficient. CTOs are expected to lead innovation, establish architecture patterns, oversee the full SDLC, and collaborate on and sometimes manage aspects of IT operations.</p>



<p>“If devops professionals want to be considered for the role of CTO, they need to take the time to master a wide range of skills,” says Alok Uniyal, SVP and head of IT process consulting practice at Infosys. “You cannot become a CTO without understanding areas such as enterprise architecture, core software engineering and operations, fostering tech innovation, the company’s business, and technology’s role in driving business value. Showing leadership that you understand all technology workstreams at a company as well as key tech trends and innovations in the industry is critical for CTO consideration.”</p>



<p>Devops professionals seeking to develop a deep and wide breadth of technology knowledge and expertise recognize it requires a commitment to lifelong learning. You can’t easily invest all the time required to dive into technology expertise, take classes in every technology, or wait for the right opportunities to join programs and teams where you can develop new skills. The most successful candidates find efficient ways to learn through reading, learning from peers, and finding mentors.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Add learning to your sprint commitments and chronicle your best practices in a journal or blog. Writing helps with retention and adds an important CTO skill of sharing and teaching.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="embrace-experiences-outside-your-comfort-zone">Embrace experiences outside your comfort zone</h3>



<p>In <em>Digital Trailblazer</em>, I recommend that leadership requires getting out of your comfort zone and seeking experiences beyond your expertise.</p>



<p>My devops career checklist includes several recommendations for embracing transformation experiences and seeking challenges that will train you to listen, question how things work today, and challenge people to think differently. For example, consider volunteering to manage an end-to-end major incident response to better understand being under pressure and finding problem root causes. That certainly will grow your appreciation of why observability is important and the value of monitoring systems.</p>



<p>However, to be a CTO, the more important challenge is to lead efforts that require participation from stakeholders, customers, and business teams. Seek out opportunities to experience change leadership:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lead a journey mapping exercise to document the end-user flows through a critical transaction and discover pain points.</li>



<li>Participate in a change management program and learn the practices required to accelerate end-user adoption of a new technology.</li>



<li>Go on a customer tour or spend time with operational teams to learn firsthand how well—or not well—the provided technology is working for them.</li>
</ul>



<p>“One of the best ways I personally achieved an uplift in the value I brought to a business came from experiencing change,” says Reggie Best, director of product management at IBM. “Within my current organization, that usually happened by changing projects or teams—gaining new experiences, developing an understanding of new technologies, and working with different people.”</p>



<p>John Pettit, CTO at Promevo, says to rise from devops professional to CTO, embrace leadership opportunities, manage teams, and align with your organization’s strategic goals. “Build business acumen by understanding how technology impacts company performance. Invest in soft skills like communication, negotiation, and strategic thinking.”</p>



<p>Petit recommends that aspiring CTOs build relationships across departments, read books on digital transformation, mentor junior engineers, develop a network by attending events, and find a mentor in a non-tech C-level leadership role.</p>



<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The path to CTO requires spending more time with people and less time working with technology. Don’t wait for experience opportunities—seek them out and get used to being uncomfortable: it’s a key aspect of learning leadership.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="develop-a-vision-and-deliver-results">Develop a vision and deliver results</h3>



<p>CTOs see their roles beyond delivering technology, architecture, data, and AI capabilities. They learn the business, customers, and employees while developing executive relationships that inform their technology strategies and roadmaps.</p>



<p>Martin Davis of Dunelm Associates recommends, “Think strategically, think holistically. Always look at the bigger picture and the longer term and how the decisions you make now play out as the organization builds, grows, and develops.”</p>



<p>My recent research of top leadership competencies of digital leaders includes strategic thinking, value creation, influencing, and passion for making a difference. These are all competencies that aspiring CTOs develop over time by taking on more challenging assignments and focusing on collaborating with people over technical problem solving.</p>



<p>Beyond strategies and roadmaps, the best CTOs are vision painters who articulate a destiny and objectives that leaders and employees embrace. They then have the leadership chops to create competitive, differentiating technical, data, and AI capabilities while reducing risks and improving security.</p>



<p>You can’t control when a CTO opportunity will present itself, but if technology leadership is your goal, you can take steps to prepare. Start by changing your mindset from <em>doing to leading</em>, then look for opportunities to guide teams and increase collaboration with business stakeholders.</p>
