<p>The Grammy Awards return February 1 at a pivotal moment for the music industry, one shaped by trending Latin artists, resurgent rock legends, and even charting AI acts. To unpack what will make this year’s broadcast distinctive, the Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. shares how Grammy winners are chosen, and how music both reflects and influences the broader business marketplace.</p>



<p><em>This is an abridged transcript of an interview from</em> Rapid Response<em>, hosted by former </em>Fast Company <em>editor-in-chief Robert Safian. From the team behind the </em>Masters of Scale <em>podcast, </em>Rapid Response <em>features candid conversations with today’s top business leaders navigating real-time challenges.

<p><strong>This year&#8217;s Grammy Awards come at an intriguing inflection point for the music business. I mean, the music business is always changing, but I was looking at your Album of the Year nominees, which feature a bunch of mega artists: Justin Bieber, Tyler the Creator, Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny. How much do Grammy nominees reflect the marketplace?</strong></p>



<p>The Grammy nominees are meant to reflect the marketplace, and that&#8217;s our hope, but it really reflects the voters’ will. And you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to resonate with the voting body year over year. We have roughly 15,000 voting members. Those members are all professional music people, whether they&#8217;re writers or arrangers or producers or artists. So they&#8217;re the peers of the people that are being nominated. Sometimes they surprise you and they vote for something that I wasn&#8217;t thinking of and sometimes they are right down the middle. But the hope is that the nominations are a direct and unencumbered reflection of what the voters appreciate and want to vote for.</p>



<p><strong>And in this sort of more fragmented media ecosystem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do the biggest artists have the same kind of cultural sway, or is the cultural impact more diffuse?</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s debatable. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#8217;m sure everyone has an opinion, but the big artists are always going to be impactful and important and shift the direction of music. And there&#8217;s always going to be a new class of creators coming up.</p>



<p><strong>KPop Demon Hunters [is] the animated band [from] this breakthrough film—the most-watched movie ever on Netflix. But the [soundtrack] album charted No. 1 on <em>Billboard</em> also. Did that surprise you? Are there any messages in that about music and where it&#8217;s going in the future?</strong></p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t surprise me, because it was really, really good. And the message that it sends is you can come from anywhere, any country, any medium. You can come off a streaming platform, off a show, off of a garage studio. And if your music resonates, it&#8217;s going to be successful. It&#8217;s going to find an audience. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s exciting to me right now about music is the diverse places where you&#8217;re finding it being created and sourced from. And also, the accessibility to audiences. You don&#8217;t have to record a record and then hopefully it gets mixed and mastered and hopefully somebody releases it and markets it the right way. You can make something and put it out. And if it creates excitement .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people are going to love it and gravitate towards it.</p>



<p><strong>One of the bands that ended up putting up big streaming numbers was the Velvet Sundown, an AI-based artist. I&#8217;m curious, is there going to be a point where AI acts have their own Grammy category? Are there any award restrictions on artists who use AI in their music now? I know there was a lot of tumult about that with the Oscars last year with <em>The Brutalist</em>.</strong></p>



<p>AI is moving so darn fast. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Month to month it&#8217;s doing new things and getting better and changing what it&#8217;s doing. So we&#8217;re just going to have to be very diligent and watch it and see what happens. My perspective is always going to be to protect the human creators, but I also have to acknowledge that AI is definitely a tool that&#8217;s going to be used. People like me or others in the studios around the world are going to be figuring out, <em>How can I use this to make some great music?</em> So for now, AI does not disqualify you from being able to submit for a Grammy. There are certain things that you have to abide by and there are certain rules that you have to follow, but it does not disqualify you from entering.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;re a songwriter, you&#8217;re a producer. Are you using AI in your own stuff?</strong></p>



<p>I am. I&#8217;m fine to admit that I am using it as a creative tool. There are times when I might want to hear a different sound or some different instrumentation. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#8217;m not going to be the creator that ever relies on AI to create something from scratch, because that&#8217;s what I love more than anything in the world is making music, being able to sit down at a piano and come up with something that represents my feelings, my emotions, what I&#8217;m going through in my life, my stories. So I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be that person that just relies on a computer or software or platform to do that for me. But I do think much like auto-tune, or like a drum machine, or like a synthesizer, there are things that can enhance what I&#8217;m trying to get from here out to here. And if those are things that come in that form, I think we&#8217;re all going to be ultimately taking advantage of them.</p>



<p>But we have to do it thoughtfully. We have to do it with guardrails. We have to do it respectfully. What is the music being trained on? Are there the right approvals? Are artists being remunerated properly? Those are all things that we have to make sure are in place.</p>



<p><strong>So, let me ask you about Latin music. I know the Latin Recording Academy split off from the Recording Academy 20 years ago or so. Do you rethink that these days? Latin music is all over the mainstream charts, and plenty of acts are getting Grammy nominations. Should Latin music be separated out?</strong></p>



<p>The history of it is a little different. We were representing music, the Latin music on the main show, and the popularity of it demanded that we have more categories. In order to feature more categories and honor the full breadth of the different genres of Latin music, we created the Latin Grammy so they could have that spotlight.</p>



<p>Currently, members of the Latin Academy are members of the U.S. Academy. So we&#8217;ve not set aside the Latin genres. We&#8217;ve not tried to separate them. We&#8217;ve only tried to highlight them and lift those genres up. As you know, in the U.S. show we feature Latin categories, we feature many Latin artists, and that will be the same this year, maybe more so, especially with the Bad Bunny success. So in no way does that try to separate the genres. And I think we&#8217;ll see some more of that in the future as other genres and other regions continue to make their music even more globally known. It&#8217;s not just about music that&#8217;s made in one country, right? At least it shouldn&#8217;t be. It should be about music everywhere in the world.</p>



<p><strong>Instead of narrowing, you might have . . . additional or supplemental academies or projects so that you have that expertise in those new and growing areas across the globe?</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. We&#8217;re going to have to continue to expand our membership. In order for us to honor all the different music that&#8217;s being made now, which is more than ever and music coming from more places than ever, our membership has to be reflective of that. Just like, I don&#8217;t know what type of music you&#8217;re a fan of, but I wouldn&#8217;t ask you if you didn&#8217;t know everything about classical to go into the classical categories and say, &#8220;What did you think was the best composing?&#8221; [There are] so many categories you wouldn&#8217;t be able to evaluate other than say, &#8220;Oh, I recognize that name. Let me vote for that.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what we can&#8217;t have. We have to have people that know the genres. And you&#8217;re seeing K-pop, you&#8217;re seeing Afrobeats, you&#8217;re seeing Latin, you&#8217;re seeing growth in the Middle East, you&#8217;re seeing growth coming out of India.</p>



<p>There are so many great artists and so many great records. And you&#8217;re hearing a blend of genres where you&#8217;re seeing Western artists interact or collaborate with artists from different parts of the world. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening. You can&#8217;t argue it. You can&#8217;t deny it. You can&#8217;t pretend that it&#8217;s not what&#8217;s going on.</p>
