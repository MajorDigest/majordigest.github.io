<p>Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs, or <em>prompts,</em> to a generative AI system that lead to the system producing better outputs. That sounds simple on the surface, but because LLMs and other gen AI tools are complex, nondeterministic “black box” systems, it’s a devilishly tricky process that involves trial and error and a certain degree of guesswork — and that’s before you even consider that the question of what constitutes “better output” is itself difficult to answer.</p>



<p>Almost every advance in computer science since COBOL has been pitched as a means for ordinary people to unlock the power of computers without having to learn any specialized languages or skills, and with natural language AI chatbots, it might seem that we’ve finally achieved that goal. But it turns out that there are a number of techniques — some intuitive, some less so — that can help you get the most from a gen AI system, and learning those techniques is quickly becoming a key skill in the AI age.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is prompt engineering important?</strong></h3>



<p>Most people’s experience with gen AI tools involves directly interacting with ChatGPT or Claude or the like. For those folks, prompt engineering techniques represent a way to get better answers out of those tools. Those tools are becoming increasingly built into business software and processes, so that’s a strong motivation to improve your prompts, just as the first generation of web users learned quirks and tricks of Google and other search engines.</p>



<p>However, prompt engineering is even more important for developers who are building an ecosystem <em>around </em>AI tools in ways that hopefully relieve some of the burden from ordinary users. Enterprise AI applications increasingly include an orchestration layer between end users and the underlying AI foundation model. This layer includes system prompts and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tools that enhance user inputs before they’re sent to the AI system.</p>



<p>For instance, a medical AI application could ask its doctor and nurse users to simply input a list of patient symptoms; the application’s orchestration layer would then turn that list into a prompt, informed by prompt engineering techniques and enhanced by information derived from RAG, that will hopefully produce the best diagnosis.</p>



<p>For developers, this orchestration layer represents the next frontier of professional work in the AI age. Just as search engines were originally aimed at ordinary users but also spawned a multibillion dollar industry in the form of search engine optimization, so too is prompt engineering becoming a vital and potentially lucrative skill.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prompt engineering types and techniques</strong></h3>



<p>Prompt engineering approaches vary in sophistication, but all serve the same goal: to guide the model’s internal reasoning and reduce the model’s tendency toward ambiguity or hallucination. The techniques fall into a few major categories:</p>



<p><strong>Zero-shot prompting</strong> is the simplest and, in many cases, the default: you give the model an instruction — “Summarize this article,” “Explain this API,” “Draft a patient note” — and the system relies entirely on its general training to produce an answer. This is referred to as <em>direct </em>or (for reasons we’ll discuss in a moment) <em>zero-shot</em> prompting; it’s useful for quick tasks, but it rarely provides the consistency or structure needed for enterprise settings, where outputs must follow predictable formats and meet compliance or quality constraints.<strong>One-shot and few-shot prompting</strong> add examples to the instruction to demonstrate the format, reasoning style, or output structure the system should follow. Here’s an example of one-shot prompting with ChatGPT:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p> One-shot prompting with ChatGPT</p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p><br></p>



<p>This is a one-shot prompt because it involves a single example, but you can add more to produce few-shot (or indeed many-shot) prompts. Direct prompts that don’t include examples were retroactively named <em>zero-shot </em>as a result.</p>



<p>Prompts of this type can be used to provide in-context learning with examples that steer the model to better performance. For instance, a model that struggles with a zero-shot instruction like “Extract key risks from this report” may respond much more reliably if given a few examples of the kinds of risks you’re talking about. In production systems, these examples are often embedded as part of the system prompt or stored in an internal prompt template library rather than visible to the end user.</p>



<p><strong>Chain-of-thought prompting</strong> takes things further, encouraging the model to break down a problem into intermediate steps. It was first developed in a 2022 paper that used the following example:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p><em>Source: “Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models,” Wei et al., 2022.</em></p>
</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Foundry</p></div>



<p>Chain-of-thought prompts can involve elaborate demonstrations of your desired reasoning, as the example demonstrates; however, it’s worth noting that contemporary LLMs are prone to engage in chain of thought reasoning on their own with even gentle nudge, like adding “show your work” to the prompt. This technique is particularly effective for reasoning tasks—anything involving classification, diagnostics, planning, multi-step decision-making, or rules interpretation.</p>



<p>The way these engineered prompts work reveals something about the nature of gen AI that’s important to keep in mind. While ChatGPT and other LLM chat interfaces create the illusion that you’re having a conversation with someone, the underlying model is fundamentally a machine for predicting the next token in sequence.</p>



<p>When you’re “talking” with it in a natural conversational style, it’s doing its best to predict, based on its training data, what the most likely next bit of dialogue in the exchange would be. But as our examples indicate, you can prompt it with a multi-“character” dialogue scaffolds, with both the Qs and the As, and then ask it to predict the next A, or indeed even the next Q; it’s perfectly happy to do so and doesn’t necessarily “identify” with either “character,” and can even switch back and forth if you prompt it correctly. Good prompt engineering techniques can make use of this rather than trying to coax an LLM into doing what you want as if it were a person.</p>



<p>Zero-shot and few-shot examples can be embedded as system-level templates, and chain-of-thought reasoning can be enforced by the software layer rather than left to user discretion. More elaborate dialogue scaffolds can shape model behavior in ways that reduce risk and improve consistency. Collectively, these techniques form the core of production-grade prompting that sits between end users and the model.</p>

<h3><strong> Prompt engineering best practices</strong></h3>


<ul ol style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
<li> Be explicit about roles and goals. Clearly define who the model is supposed to act as and what the output should achieve.</li>
<li> Use examples to demonstrate patterns. One-shot and few-shot prompts help the model infer structure, formatting, and reasoning style.</li>
<li> Break tasks into steps. Chain-of-thought prompts improve reasoning by decomposing complex queries.</li>
<li> Constrain the model’s sources. In RAG systems, instruct the model to rely only on retrieved documents or verified context.</li>
<li> Specify format requirements. JSON, XML, bullet points, or templates reduce ambiguity and ease downstream parsing.</li>
<li> Test prompts across model versions. Small model updates can alter prompt behavior, so continuous evaluation is essential.</li>
<li> Document and version prompts. Treat prompts like software artifacts to maintain consistency and traceability.</li>
<li> Avoid overloaded instructions. Shorter, clearer prompts reduce the chance of unexpected model interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</aside>




<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prompt engineering challenges</strong></h3>



<p>Prompt engineering remains a rapidly evolving discipline, and that brings real challenges. One issue is the fragility of prompts: even small changes in wording can cause large shifts in output quality. Prompts tuned for one model version do not always behave identically in a newer version, meaning organizations face ongoing maintenance simply to keep outputs stable as models update.</p>



<p>A related problem is opacity. Because LLMs are black-box systems, a strong prompt does not guarantee strong reasoning; it only increases the likelihood that the model interprets instructions correctly. Studies have highlighted the gap between well-engineered prompts and trustworthy outputs. In regulated industries, a model that merely sounds confident can be dangerous if the underlying prompt does not constrain it sufficiently. (We’ve already compared prompt engineering to SEO, and fragility and opacity are problems familiar to SEO practitioners.)</p>



<p>Enterprise teams also face scalability issues. Due to LLMs’ nondeterministic nature, a prompt that works for a single request may not perform consistently across thousands of queries, each with slightly different inputs. As businesses move toward broader deployments, this inconsistency can translate into productivity losses, compliance risks, or increased human review needs.</p>



<p>Security risk is another emerging challenge. Prompt-injection attacks, where malformed user input or retrieval content manipulates the internal prompt templates, are now practical threats.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prompt engineering courses</strong></h3>



<p>One more challenge in the prompt engineering landscape: The skills gap remains significant. Enterprises understand the importance of prompt engineering, but the technology and techniques are so new that few professionals have hands-on experience building robust prompt pipelines. This gap is driving demand for the growing list of prompt engineering courses and certifications.</p>



<p>Companies themselves are increasingly offering internal training as they roll out generative AI. Citi, for example, has made AI prompt training mandatory for roughly 175,000–180,000 employees who can access its AI tools, framing it as a way to boost AI proficiency across the workforce. Deloitte’s AI Academy similarly aims to train more than 120,000 professionals on generative AI and related skills.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prompt engineering jobs</strong></h3>



<p>There’s rising demand for professionals who can design prompt templates, build orchestration layers, and integrate prompts with retrieval systems and pipelines. Employers increasingly want practitioners with AI skills who understand not just prompting, but how to integrate them with retrieval systems and tool-use.</p>



<p>These roles often emphasize hybrid responsibilities: evaluating model updates, maintaining prompt libraries, testing output quality, implementing safety constraints, and embedding prompts into multi-step agent workflows. As companies deploy AI deeper into customer support, analytics, and operations, prompt engineers must collaborate with security, compliance, and UX teams to prevent hallucination, drift or unexpected system behavior.</p>



<p>Despite some skepticism about the longevity of “prompt engineer” as a standalone title, the underlying competencies—structured reasoning, workflow design, prompt orchestration, evaluation and integration—are becoming core to broader AI engineering disciplines. Demand for talent remains strong, and compensation for AI skills continues to rise.</p>
