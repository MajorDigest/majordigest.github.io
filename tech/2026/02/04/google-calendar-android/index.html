<p>Google Calendar is a core part of the Android productivity package — but if all you’re using is what you see on the app’s surface, you’re missing out on some pretty powerful possibilities.</p>



<p>Yes, oh yes: Just like so many of our modern digital tools, there’s more to Google Calendar than meets the eye. And while the majority of the service’s advanced options may revolve around the Calendar website, the Calendar Android app has its share of handy out-of-sight options that are specific to the mobile experience. From time-saving shortcuts to efficiency-boosting options, they’re all things that have the potential to make your life easier in small but significant ways.</p>



<p>Find time in your agenda to check out these hidden Google Calendar goodies on Android. Trust me: You’ll be glad you did.</p>



<p>(Note that these tips are all specific to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Google </em>Calendar Android app</a>, which is free and available to use on any Android device — though not necessarily always the <em>default</em> calendar app that’s present on <em>all </em>devices out of the box.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-1-quick-peeking">Google Calendar Android trick #1: Quick peeking</h3>



<p>Tell me if you can relate to this: You head into the Calendar app on your phone to create a new event. You open the screen to add the event in — and then you find yourself facing a foggy mental blank.</p>



<p>What else did you have going on that day? Did you need to schedule the event for 2:00 p.m., or would 3:00 be better? When was that podiatrist appointment, again?</p>



<p><strong>[Psst: Love shortcuts? My </strong><a href="https://www.theintelligence.com/shortcut-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Android Shortcut Supercourse</strong></a><strong> will teach you tons of time-saving tricks for your phone. </strong><a href="https://www.theintelligence.com/shortcut-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Sign up now for free</strong></a><strong>!]</strong></p>



<p>I’ve certainly been there (well, not to the podiatrist, specifically, but in the general event brain fog situation). And the Android Calendar app doesn’t do much to offer any broader calendar context while you’re in the midst of adding in a new event.</p>



<p>Or so it’d seem. After years of using Google Calendar on Android, I not long ago noticed a curiously camouflaged option that’ll change the way you create events on your phone.</p>



<p>See that barely noticeable light-gray line at the top of the Calendar app’s event creation screen? The one that looks vaguely like an arrow pointing downward?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Yup, that’s the one. The next time you’re adding a new event on your phone and you find yourself wondering what else is on your agenda around that same time, tap that line — or, alternatively, use it as a hint to swipe downward anywhere within the main event creation area of the screen.</p>



<p>And…</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Wouldya look at that?! You can actually minimize that event creation interface down to a tiny panel and browse around on your calendar above it.</p>



<p>And that’s not all…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-2-simple-sliding">Google Calendar Android trick #2: Simple sliding</h3>



<p>After you’ve entered that concealed quick-peek view, remember this: If you decide you need to shift your new event around to another time, you can simply touch and hold the outline on your screen and slide your finger up and down to move it.</p>



<p>Nifty, no? And there’s one more piece to this puzzle yet…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-3-gesture-adjusting">Google Calendar Android trick #3: Gesture adjusting</h3>



<p>In addition to sliding an event around to move it in the Calendar Android app’s event creation quick-peek interface, you can touch your finger to the dots on the top or bottom of your event’s outline and then slide up or down from there to make the event longer or shorter.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Now if only our <em>actual</em> meetings could be condensed down so easily.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-4-instant-perspective">Google Calendar Android trick #4: Instant perspective</h3>



<p>When you need to glance at a full-month view whilst thumbing through your events, take note of the following invisible Android Calendar shortcut: You can tap or swipe downward on the app’s top bar — where it says the current month’s name — to bring a monthly view into focus. Tap on the bar a second time (or swipe back up, with your finger starting just beneath that area) to hide it when you’re done.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Who knew?! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-5-expanded-intelligence">Google Calendar Android trick #5: Expanded intelligence</h3>



<p>Looking at the Google Calendar app on an Android tablet — or a folding phone like the Pixel Fold in its fully unfolded state? You’ve got even <em>more</em> agenda-expanding magic at your fingertips and just begging to be found.</p>



<p>By default on any such device, the Calendar app will expand to take advantage of that screen space in a variety of scenarios. What <em>isn’t</em> obvious, though, is the fact that you can split and then customize your view anytime with a simple on-screen swipe.</p>



<p>In any view other than the Month overview, look for a thin gray line at the left of the screen. (Again: This’ll work only when you’re using the app on a larger-screened device — either a tablet or a fully unfolded foldable.)</p>



<p>Slide your finger on that line toward the right — and hey, how ’bout that?!</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>You can see the full month view right there alongside whatever else you were viewing — at any width you like.</p>



<p>To get to a similar sort of setup from the main Month view, just tap on any event in the calendar. That’ll pull up detailed info about the event in a separate panel to the left — which, once more, you can customize and resize by sliding your finger along the thin gray line separating the two panels.</p>



<p>Not bad, eh?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-6-time-travel">Google Calendar Android trick #6: Time travel</h3>



<p>If you’re already in the Android Calendar app’s full-screen Month view — no matter <em>what</em> type of device you’re using — try tapping on that same month’s name at the top of the screen.</p>



<p>From that view, that action will reveal a nifty new quick-jump bar for quickly zipping forward or back in time to any month imaginable — no scrolling, flipping, or futzing around required.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>And speaking of shadowy shortcuts…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-7-snazzy-snapping">Google Calendar Android trick #7: Snazzy snapping</h3>



<p>Anytime you’re scrolling through your Schedule view in the Calendar app and want to jump back to the <em>current </em>day, tap the small calendar icon (the box with the current date in it, directly to the left of your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the screen).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>That’ll beam you instantly back to today, no matter how far into the future you’ve traveled.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-8-sneaky-selecting">Google Calendar Android trick #8: Sneaky selecting</h3>



<p>Speaking of that top-of-screen current date icon, that same symbol holds <em>another</em> rarely noticed shortcut:</p>



<p>You can press and <em>hold</em> it for a second to summon a scrollable calendar pop-up that makes it easy to select and jump directly to any date, anytime.</p>



<p>Go give it a whirl, then train your brain to remember it’s there and waiting the next time you need to leap around (regardless of whether it’s a leap year).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-9-tasks-on-demand">Google Calendar Android trick #9: Tasks on demand</h3>



<p>While we’ve got our attention on that upper-right corner area of the Google Calendar Android app interface, be sure to take note of a relatively recently added option that’s all too easy to overlook.</p>



<p>After months of awkwardly disconnected existences, Google’s now integrated Google Tasks directly into the Calendar Android app — so you can see and manage all of your tasks right within your calendar environment, without having to toggle over to the separate standalone Tasks app.</p>



<p>Just tap the small circled checkmark icon in the Calendar app’s upper-right corner, directly to the right of the current day box we were just chewing over.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>You can still move over to the full Tasks app if you want, but there’s really no need to — since everything you need is now right where you’re already looking, anyway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-10-speedy-deleting">Google Calendar Android trick #10: Speedy deleting</h3>



<p>Here’s an easily missed and incredibly handy gesture in the Google Calendar Android app: From the Schedule view, you can swipe any event or reminder toward the right to delete it in a single, swift action.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>So long, responsibilities!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-11-quick-creation">Google Calendar Android trick #11: Quick creation</h3>



<p>In addition to <em>deleting</em> events at the speed of light, you can also <em>create</em> new events in a delightfully swift way within the Google Calendar app — right from your daily calendar view.</p>



<p>All you’ve gotta do is tap on any open space in that part of the Android Calendar app, and you’ll see an event creation box right then and there:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Also worth noting: The same tricks we went over a second ago for sliding around or extending your event’s time will work in this context, too, once you’ve brought that box into focus.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-12-easier-adding">Google Calendar Android trick #12: Easier adding</h3>



<p>For reasons I’ll never quite fathom, Google recently <em>removed</em> an exceptionally useful shortcut for double-tapping the Calendar app’s new event button to move past the standard menu of options and zoom right into the new event creation interface. Bah!</p>



<p>But while <em>that</em> capability is seemingly now in the ever-cluttered Google graveyard, there <em>is</em> another helpful way to create a new event without wasting any unnecessary steps or time. In fact, you don’t even have to futz around in the Calendar app at all to find it.</p>



<p>It’s something known as an Android app shortcut, which means all you’ve gotta do is press and hold the Calendar app’s icon on your home screen or in your app drawer to find it.</p>



<p>One quick long-press on that icon, and you’ll see a direct link to the Google Calendar new event function — no app-opening, button-pressing, or menu-wading required:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, Foundry</p></div>



<p>If you <em>really</em> wanna get fancy, you can also press and hold your finger onto the “New event” shortcut to drag it directly onto your home screen for even easier ongoing access, so it’s never more than a single tap away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-13-practical-pinching">Google Calendar Android trick #13: Practical pinching</h3>



<p>While we’re thinking about all this tapping and swiping, make a mental note of this: Whilst gazing uponst the Google Calendar app’s Day, 3-Day, Week, or Month view on Android, you can actually pinch your fingers apart on the screen to expand the interface and make everything bigger — or pinch ’em together to condense it and make all the elements smaller.</p>



<p>The key is to place your fingers <em>on top</em> of each other and move ’em in an <em>up and down</em> motion or diagonally — <em>not </em>sideways:</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Whee!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-14-find-the-time">Google Calendar Android trick #14: Find the time</h3>



<p>Here’s a fun one I discovered a while back, thanks to a tip from a resourceful Android Intelligence reader:</p>



<p>When you’re looking at the Google Calendar Android app’s Day view and you have an event that starts at a time that isn’t at the top of an hour — say, at 12:30 p.m., 1:05 p.m., 3:33 p.m., or any other such number — it can be tough to know <em>exactly</em> what time the event begins at a glance.</p>



<p>But if you press and hold your finger onto the event for a second, the Calendar app will adjust the number on the time grid at the left to show the exact start time for that specific item.</p>



<p>See?</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>The precise time will remain present for as long as you keep your finger pressed.</p>



<p>And speaking of that area of the Android Calendar interface…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-15-a-jaunty-jump">Google Calendar Android trick #15: A jaunty jump</h3>



<p>An easy and not-at-all-obvious way to move between different calendar views is hiding in the leftmost column of the Google Calendar app’s Android interface — specifically, in the Day and Schedule views.</p>



<p>Starting in Schedule, you can tap the day name and number next to any events to jump directly to the Day view for that date — and then, when in the Day view, you can tap that <em>same</em> day name and number indicator (now in the upper-left corner of the screen) to bop back over into Schedule.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, IDG</p></div>



<p>Hip, hip, hoorah!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-16-meet-no-more">Google Calendar Android trick #16: Meet no more</h3>



<p>Have you ever noticed how Calendar developed an irksome habit of automatically adding Google Meet links into <em>every forkin’ event </em>you create?</p>



<p>That’s fine and dandy if your event actually includes a Meet-based video meeting, but it’s pretty annoying — and potentially confusing — when your event is something that’s in person. Worse yet is when your event is virtual but in a <em>different</em> video meeting service, like Zoom, and then everyone you invite ends up getting both the correct link and a meaningless Meet link for the same event.</p>



<p>Here’s a little secret: You can put a stop to this madness. And all it takes is a handful of quick taps in your Android Calendar app.</p>



<p>Open up Google Calendar on your phone, tap the three-line menu icon in its upper-left corner, and scroll down to the bottom to select “Settings.”</p>



<p>Tap “General,” then tap “Add video conferencing” and turn the toggles into the off position for every account you’ve got connected.</p>



<p>Now, if you ever want to add a Meet link to an event, you can do so manually whilst creating said event. But by default, those blasted links won’t get auto-added onto every single event for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-17-smarter-silencing">Google Calendar Android trick #17: Smarter silencing</h3>



<p>This one is technically an <em>Android </em>feature, but it works hand in hand with Calendar and is one of the most practical options out there: the ability for your phone to automatically silence itself anytime an event from your Google Calendar is underway.</p>



<p>All you’ve gotta do is enable it, provided your phone-maker hasn’t removed the option: On a device running Android 16 and up without any major manufacturer modifications, look for the new Android Modes menu within your main system settings. Tap the option to create your own custom mode, give it a name like “Events,” then tap the option to “Set a schedule” and select “Calendar events” from the pop-up that appears next.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, Foundry</p></div>



<p>Then, you can customize to your heart’s content — selecting which specific calendar and sorts of events will trigger the mode and deciding <em>exactly</em> what happens when it’s active and what, if any, exceptions for its phone-silencing action should exist.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><p class="imageCredit">JR Raphael, Foundry</p></div>



<p>Not seeing any of this on your device? If you’re using a phone with an older Android version, a similar sort of setup may exist within a “Do Not Disturb” area of your system settings — within the Sound section.</p>



<p>If you’re using a phone whose manufacturer has fudged around with this part of the operating system — as is the case, unfortunately, with Samsung and its many Android gadgets — you can set up your own standalone equivalent of the same basic concept by embracing this purpose-specific app or the brilliantly versatile MacroDroid automation creation utility.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-18-rapid-responses">Google Calendar Android trick #18: Rapid responses</h3>



<p>Just like Android itself allows you to send a prewritten quick response when you’re rejecting a call, Google’s Android Calendar app can let you send a speedy note to anyone involved in an upcoming meeting — all with a couple quick taps on your phone.</p>



<p>To configure the feature, open up the Calendar app, tap the three-line menu icon in the upper-left corner, and select “Settings” from the menu that appears.</p>



<p>Next, select “General,” then scroll down until you see “Quick responses.” Tap that — and there, you’ll see four options for prewritten messages you can fire off on the fly while en route to any appointment involving multiple mammals.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"></div>



<p>Oddly, Calendar doesn’t let you create <em>additional</em> responses, but you can edit any of the default responses to make it say whatever you want. Just tap any one of ’em and then replace it with whatever text your silly ol’ heart desires.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"></div>



<p>To put your custom quick responses to use, open up any upcoming event that has at least one other person invited. Tap the envelope icon within the “Guests” line, then tap the response you want from the list.</p>



<p>That’ll take you directly to a ready-to-roll email with your message in place and the recipients added in. All that’s left is to hit “Send” — and maybe let out a guffaw in delight, should such inspiration strike.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-19-duplication-elation">Google Calendar Android trick #19: Duplication elation</h3>



<p>Ever find yourself needing to create a new event that’s remarkably similar to one already on your agenda? The Google Calendar app for Android has an easy way to duplicate an event and then use it as a blueprint for a new one: Just tap the event you want to emulate, tap the three-dot menu icon in its upper-right corner, and select — yup, you guessed it — “Duplicate.”</p>



<p>And that’s it: Your new event will show up with the original event’s info filled in and ready for to be tweaked as needed.</p>



<p>Doesn’t get much easier than that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-calendar-android-trick-20-nicer-notifications">Google Calendar Android trick #20: Nicer notifications</h3>



<p>Google Calendar’s default notification times for new events aren’t right for everyone. If you find yourself changing the setting for when an event will notify you more often than not (and/or quietly muttering creative curses every time an event notifies you earlier or later than you’d like), do yourself a favor and adjust your Calendar’s default notification times so that they work better for you.</p>



<p>Just head back into the Calendar app’s settings section — and this time, find the section for the Google account you want to modify and tap the “My calendar” line beneath it. That’ll give you a screen on which you can change the default notification times for standard new events as well as all-day events. You can even add multiple notifications, if you want, and change the default color for events on that calendar while you’re at it (ooh, ahh, etc).</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"></div>



<p>If you want to change the default notification time for tasks or for any secondary calendars you’ve created within a particular Google account, just find the appropriate line beneath the account’s header and select that instead of “My calendar” — then make the same sorts of modifications there.</p>
