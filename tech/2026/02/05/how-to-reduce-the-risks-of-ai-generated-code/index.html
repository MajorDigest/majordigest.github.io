<p>Vibe coding is the latest tech accelerator, and yes, it kind of rocks. New AI-assisted coding practices are helping developers ship new applications faster, and they’re even allowing other business professionals to prototype workflows and tools without waiting for a full engineering cycle.</p>



<p>Using a chatbot and tailored prompts, vibe coders can build applications in a flash and get them into production within days. Gartner even estimates that by 2028, 40% of new enterprise software will be built with vibe coding tools and techniques, rather than traditional, human-led waterfall or agile software development methods. The speed is intoxicating, so I, for one, am not surprised by that prediction.</p>



<p>The challenge here is that when those who aren’t coders—and even some of those who do work with code for a living—get an application that does exactly what they want, they think the work is over. In truth, it has only just begun.</p>



<p>After the app, then comes the maintenance: updating the app, patching it, scaling it, and defending it. And before you expose real users and data to risk, you must first understand the route that AI took to get your new app working. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>How vibe coding works</h3>



<p>Vibe coding tools and applications are built on large language models (LLMs) and trained on existing code and patterns. You prompt the model with ideas for your application and, in turn, it generates artifacts like code, configurations, UI components, etc. When you try to run the code, or look at the application’s front end, you’ll see one of two things: the application will look and run the way you were expecting, or an error message will be generated. Then comes the iterative phase, tweaking or changing code until you finally get the desired outcome.</p>



<p>Ideally, the end result is a working app that follows software development best practices based on what AI has learned and produced before. However, AI might just help you produce an application that functions and looks great, but is fragile, inefficient, or insecure at the foundational level.</p>



<p>The biggest issue is that this approach does not often account for the learned security and engineering experience that is needed to operate securely in production, where attackers, compliance requirements, customer trust, and operational scale all converge at once. So, if you’re not a security professional or accustomed to developing apps, what do you do?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="just-because-it-works-doesnt-mean-its-ready">Just because it works doesn’t mean it’s ready</h3>



<p>The first step to solving a problem is knowing that it exists. A vibe-coded prototype can be a win as a proof of concept, but the danger is in treating it as production-ready.</p>



<p>Start with awareness. Use existing security frameworks to check that your application is secure. Microsoft’s STRIDE threat model is a practical way to sanity-check a vibe-coded application before it goes live. STRIDE stands for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Spoofing</li>



<li>Tampering</li>



<li>Repudiation</li>



<li>Information disclosure</li>



<li>Denial of service</li>



<li>Elevation of privilege</li>
</ul>



<p>Use STRIDE as a guide to ask yourself the uncomfortable questions before someone else does. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Can someone pretend to be another user?</li>



<li>Does the app leak data through errors, logs, or APIs?</li>



<li>Are there rate limits and timeouts, or can requests be spammed?</li>
</ul>



<p>To prevent those potential issues, you can check that your new vibe-coded application handles identities correctly and is secure by default. On top of this, you should make sure that the app code doesn’t have any embedded credentials that others can access.</p>



<p>These real-world concerns are common to all applications, whether they’re built by AI or humans. Being aware of issues preemptively allows you to take practical steps toward a more robust defense. This takes you from “it works” to “we understand how it could fail.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="humans-are-still-necessary-for-good-vibes">Humans are still necessary for good vibes</h3>



<p>Regardless of your personal opinion on vibe coding, it’s not going anywhere. It helps developers and line-of-business teams build what they need (or want), and that <em>is</em> useful. That newfound freedom and ability to create apps, however, must be matched with awareness that security is necessary and cannot be assumed.</p>



<p>The goal of secure vibe coding isn’t to kill momentum—it’s to keep the speed of innovation high <em>and</em> reduce the potential blast radius for threats.</p>



<p>Whatever your level of experience with AI-assisted coding, or even coding in general, there are tools and practices you can use to ensure your vibe-coded applications are secure. When these applications are developed quickly, any security steps must be just as fast-paced and easy to implement. This begins with taking responsibility for your code from the start, and then maintaining it over time. Start on security early–ideally, as you plan your application and begin its initial reviews. Earlier is <em>always</em> better than trying to bolt security on afterward.</p>



<p>After your vibe-coded app is complete and you’ve done some initial security due diligence, you can then look into your long-term approach. While vibe coding is great for testing or initial builds, it is not often the best approach for full-scale applications that must be able to support a growing number of users. At this point, you can implement more effective threat modeling and automated safety guardrails for more effective security. Bring in a developer or engineer while you’re at it, too.</p>



<p>There are many other security best practices to begin following at this point in the process, too. Using software scanning tools, for example, you can see what your application relies on in terms of software packages and/or additional tools, and then check that list for potential vulnerabilities. Alongside evaluating third-part risk, you can move to CI/CD pipeline security checks, such as blocking hardcoded secrets with pre-commit hooks. You can also use metadata around any AI-assisted contributions within the application to show what was written with AI, which models were used to generate that code, and which LLM tools were involved in building your application.</p>



<p>Ultimately, vibe coding helps you build quickly and deploy what you want to see in the world. And while speed is great, security should be non-negotiable. Without the right security practices in place, vibe coding opens you up to a swarm of preventable problems, a slough of undue risk, or worse.</p>
