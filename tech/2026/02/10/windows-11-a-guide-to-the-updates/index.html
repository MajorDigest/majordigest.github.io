<p>A Windows launch isn’t the end a process — it’s really just the beginning. Microsoft continually works on improving Windows 11 by fixing bugs, releasing security patches, and occasionally adding new features.</p>



<p>In this story we summarize what you need to know about each update released to the public for the most recent version of Windows 11 — currently version 25H2 — over the past year. For each build, we’ve included the date of its release and a link to Microsoft’s announcement about it. The most recent updates appear first.</p>



<p>The easiest way to install updates is via Windows Update. Not sure how? See “How to handle Windows 10 and 11 updates” for full instructions. Note that Windows 11 version 25H2 is being released as a phased rollout and may not be available to you in Windows Update yet.</p>



<p><em>If you’re still using Windows 10, see “Windows 10: A guide to the updates.” And if you’re looking for information about Insider Program previews for upcoming feature releases of Windows 11, see “Windows 11 Insider Previews: What’s in the latest build?”</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="updates-for-windows-11-25h2-and-24h2">Updates for Windows 11 25H2 and 24H2</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kb5077181-os-builds-26200-7840-and-26100-7840">KB5077181 (OS Builds 26200.7840 and 26100.7840)</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> February 10, 2025</p>



<p>This Patch Tuesday build fixes several bugs, including one that prevented some devices from connecting to certain WPA3‑Personal Wi‑Fi networks. It also includes a broad set of targeting data that identifies devices and their ability to receive new Secure Boot certificates. Devices will receive the new certificates only after they show sufficient successful update signals, which helps ensure a safe and phased rollout.</p>



<p>It also has a wide variety of security updates. For details, see Microsoft’s Security Update Guide and February 2026 Security Updates.</p>



<p><strong>What IT needs to know:</strong> Because this is a security update, it should be applied relatively soon. Over the next few weeks, check for reports about problematic issues, and if all seems well, apply the update.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kb5074105-os-builds-26200-7705-and-26100-7705-preview">KB5074105 (OS Builds 26200.7705 and 26100.7705) Preview</h3>



<p><strong>Release date:</strong> January 29, 2025</p>



<p>In this build, several new features are immediately available, including one for Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI) domain backup key management. Administrators can now set how often keys rotate automatically. This strengthens cryptographic security and reduces reliance on older encryption algorithms.</p>



<p>One new feature is being gradually rolled out: The Settings Agent now supports more languages, with expanded support for German, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Italian, and Chinese (Simplified).</p>



<p>A variety of bugs have been fixed, including one that caused some systems to stop responding during startup when Windows Boot Manager debugging was enabled.</p>

<p>This update fixes a bug in which some applications were unresponsive or encountered unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-based storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox. In certain Outlook configurations that store PST files on OneDrive, Outlook sometimes hung and failed to reopen unless the process was terminated or the system was restarted. Users may have also experienced missing sent items or previously downloaded emails.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-11-25h2">Windows 11 25H2</h3>



<p>At the end of September, Microsoft upgraded Windows 11 from version 24H2 to 25H2, in a slow rollout that could take months to complete. Typically in the past, Microsoft would introduce new features in a once-a-year update like this. That’s not the case with 25H2, though.</p>



<p>Microsoft has been introducing new features in smaller updates all year round, so 25H2 doesn’t include any major new features. Rather, it includes all the new features that have accumulated in all those smaller updates.</p>



<p>As the company explains, “While this update doesn’t introduce major new features, it activates enhancements that have been gradually rolled out over the past year ensuring your device is up to date with the latest refinements.”</p>



<p>Here are some of the most important features in 25H2 that have been introduced for end users and IT pros since 24H2 was released last fall:</p>



<p><strong>New features for users</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>File Explorer has several useful new features, notably AI actions, which can edit images or summarize documents. AI options such as Blur background, Erase objects, and Remove background are all now displayed in the context menu.</li>



<li>Task Manager gets a number of minor tweaks, including performance improvements when changing the sort order of processes.</li>



<li>You can now display the apps that have recently used on-device generative AI models provided by Windows. You can also choose which apps are permitted to use the generative AI technologies. To do that and more, go to <em>Settings > Privacy & security > Text and Image Generation</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New features for IT</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>IT admins can use policy-based tools to easily remove preinstalled Microsoft Store apps from Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 11, version 25H2 and later. This can streamline device provisioning and prevent removed apps such as Microsoft Clipchamp, Media Player, and Microsoft Teams from being reinstalled. For more information, see Policy-based removal of preinstalled Microsoft Store apps and RemoveDefaultMicrosoftStorePackages in the ApplicationManagement Policy CSP.</li>



<li>Enterprise access points now support Wi-Fi 7, which enables increased speeds, greater throughput, improved reliability, and enhanced security. For details, see https://aka.ms/WiFi7forEnterprise.</li>



<li>Windows Backup for Organizations is now generally available.</li>



<li>A new feature called Quick Machine Recovery can recover Windows devices when they encounter critical errors that prevent them from booting. Quick machine recovery searches for remediations in the cloud and recovers from widespread boot failures, reducing the burden on IT admins on cases when multiple devices are affected. For more information, see Computerworld’s Quick Machine Recovery explainer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> September 22, 2025</p>



<p>This update fixes a bug that affected Microsoft Office applications running in Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) environments. The failure occurred due to a double handle closure in the AppVEntSubsystems32 or AppVEntSubsystems64 system component.</p>



<p>There is one issue in this build: you might fail to connect to shared files and folders using the Server Message Block (SMB) v1 protocol on NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT). This issue can occur if either the SMB client or the SMB server has the September 2025 security update installed.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> September 9, 2025</p>



<p>This build fixes several bugs, including one that caused non-admin users to receive unexpected User Account Control (UAC) prompts when MSI installers performed certain custom actions, such as configuration or repair operations in the foreground or background during the initial installation of an application.</p>



<p>The build also has a wide variety of security updates. For details, see Microsoft’s Security Update Guide and September 2025 Security Updates.</p>

<p><strong>Release date:</strong> August 29, 2025</p>



<p>A wide variety of new features are being gradually rolled out in this build, including a new personalized homepage in Windows Recall that displays your recent activity and top-used apps and websites (available only in Copilot+ PCs). Among the changes rolling out to all users is a new grid view for Search from the Windows taskbar that helps you more quickly and accurately identify the desired image within your search.</p>



<p>Several bugs have also been fixed, including one in which some system recovery features did not work properly due to a temporary file sharing conflict. This affected certain device management tools and disrupted key functions on some devices.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kb5063878-os-build-26100-4946">KB5063878 (OS Build 26100.4946)</h3>
