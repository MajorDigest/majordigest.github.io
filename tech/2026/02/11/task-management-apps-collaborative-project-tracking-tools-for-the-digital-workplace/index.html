<p>The digital workplace has outgrown the simple project checklists you may have once associated with task management apps. The software has moved from passive repositories for to-do lists to active participants in workflows. </p>



<p>In 2026, the biggest shift in task management applications is the rise of agentic AI<strong>. </strong>The category has moved from simple automation (e.g., if <em>this</em>, then <em>that</em> logic) to autonomy. By integrating AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute, these platforms are delivering on a decade-old promise of eliminating work about work.</p>



<p>Keeping projects on track remains a challenge for enterprises of all sizes, but the stakes are getting even higher. Recent data from the Project Management Institute (PMI) suggests that while organizations have improved, the average project performance rate still hovers around 74%, leaving lots of room for improvement.</p>



<p>However, the PMI reports a massive divide between teams that prioritize “power skills” and AI-driven business acumen and those that stick to traditional methods, with the former seeing 27% lower failure rates.</p>



<p>The goal of task management apps has moved beyond mere visibility. Analyst firm <strong>Gartner predicts</strong> that by the end of 2026, 40% of enterprise applications will deploy task-specific AI agents, a whopping leap from less than 5% just a year ago.</p>



<p>“AI agents will evolve rapidly, progressing from task- and application-specific agents to agentic ecosystems,” Anushree Verma, a senior director analyst at Gartner, said in a company statement. “This shift will transform enterprise applications from tools supporting individual productivity into platforms enabling seamless autonomous collaboration and dynamic workflow orchestration.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-task-management-tools">What are task management tools?</h3>



<p>Task management software, also referred to as collaborative work management tools or work coordination platforms, has a variety of uses. These range from personal task lists or ad-hoc projects with small teams up to complex projects involving numerous stakeholders, such as the launch of a new product that touches several business departments.</p>



<p>Compared to sophisticated project portfolio management (PPM) tools, task management apps have a gentler learning curve and tend to be more accessible for all types of employees, not just trained project managers. At the same time, collaborative task management apps offer more functionality than basic to-do list apps.</p>



<p>In many cases, task management apps are available under “freemium” payment models, enticing users with limited free versions and offering more features with paid plans. This approach has made the tools popular among small businesses and startups, as well as within small pockets of larger companies.</p>



<p>Task management software vendors are also focused on building out features that appeal to IT teams at large enterprise organizations. This means adding security and administration tools required by IT, as well as compliance with certain data protection regulations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-do-look-for-in-task-management-software">What do look for in task management software</h3>



<p>According to software review site G2, these are the features you should expect in task management applications:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-future-of-task-management">The future of task management</h3>



<p>For IT leaders, the challenge is no longer just choosing the right tool but mastering the collaboration between humans and algorithms. Those who successfully bridge this gap won’t just keep their projects on track — they will redefine what their team goals. </p>



<p>Driving that collaboration will be task intelligence. According to Forrester principal analyst Betsy Summers, task intelligence offers insights about automation potential, duplication across teams, transferability,  and cost to outsource. </p>



<p>“This level of task intelligence will be key to unlocking meaningful workforce optimization,” Summers writes in a recent blog post. “It’s a lens for understanding how work happens now — and how it can happen better.”</p>
