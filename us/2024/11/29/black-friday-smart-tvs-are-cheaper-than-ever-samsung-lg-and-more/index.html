It has the virtue of using the top display technology, OLED, with its precise individual-pixel lighting and wide viewing angles, plus LG’s Brightness Booster Max feature to enhance the image even in bright rooms. Like its successor G4 line, this LG G3 lies almost flat on a wall when you hang it. It offers Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos and has a filmmaker mode that turns post-processing off so you see a movie as close to what the director intended as possible. A hands-free remote works with both Alexa and Google Assistant.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who has the best TV deals on Black Friday?</h3>



<p>Black Friday sometimes seems made for buying TVs. The big-box retailers, such as Walmart, Best Buy, Target and others, always try to outdo each other on doorbuster deals for TVs. These deals often are mirrored online, not just by the retailers’ own websites but also on Amazon. Some TV makers themselves, like Samsung, also offer steep discounts on their TVs direct from their web stores.</p>
