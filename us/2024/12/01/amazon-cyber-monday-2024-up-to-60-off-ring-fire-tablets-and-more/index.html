<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do you need a Prime membership?</h3>



<p>Unlike other major Amazon sales, the Amazon Cyber Monday sale is open to everyone. Amazon sales, such as Prime Day and&nbsp;Prime Big Deals Day, are available only to Prime members. The main&nbsp;reason for Cyber Monday being open to everyone is because it&nbsp;is a major sale event for all retailers, meaning Amazon doesn’t want to limit shoppers to only Prime members.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to find the best Amazon Cyber Monday deals</h3>



<p>If you want to optimize your savings during the Amazon Cyber Monday sale, you can use a few strategies to find the best deals. For starters, BestReviews keeps our daily page updated with the hottest deals, and our best Cyber Monday deals will be consistently updated from now until the end of the event.</p>



<p>We also recommend browsing Amazon’s website daily and signing up for a Prime membership if you don’t have one. It’s not required for the Amazon Cyber Monday sale, but you’ll get exclusive offers and early access to the best deals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black Friday/Cyber Monday vs. Prime Day</h3>



<p>The Amazon Black Friday/Cyber Monday sale is more popular than Prime Day because it’s open to everyone. However, each one has its strengths in terms of deals. Generally, you’ll accrue more savings shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday than Prime Day, mainly if you focus primarily on items such as toys, home decor and appliances. Prime Day offers better discounts on tech and gadgets, but you’ll also find excellent deals on those items on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>



<p><em>Prices listed reflect time and date of publication and are subject to change.</em></p>



<p><em>Check out our&nbsp;Daily Deals&nbsp;for the best products at the best prices and sign up&nbsp;here&nbsp;to receive the BestReviews weekly newsletter full of shopping inspo and sales.</em></p>
