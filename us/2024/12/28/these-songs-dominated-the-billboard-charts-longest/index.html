<p>(Stacker) - Every now and then, a new song releases and dominates radio airwaves, Spotify playlists, and, of course, the esteemed Billboard Hot 100 chart—and in terms of those types of hits, 2024 has been pretty impressive.</p>



<p>Morgan Wallen and Post Malone's collaboration "I Had Some Help" became the first major hit of the year. It spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and was named the official song of the summer. The single was succeeded by another country-pop track, Shaboozey's "A Bar Song (Tipsy)," which spent 19 nonconsecutive weeks at #1 from July to November 2024. The song tied the all-time record Lil Nas X set in 2019 with "Old Town Road," featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, and became the longest-running #1 of the 2020s. "A Bar Song" was also the first single from a Black male artist to top both the Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts. Historically, there have been many songs that, for whatever reason, just seem to stick, from Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" to Morgan Wallen's "Last Night." So today, it's time to inspect the top 100 songs that dominated the charts the longest.</p>



<p>To determine the longest-serving songs, Stacker consulted the Billboard Hot 100 as of Dec. 14, 2024. Songs are ranked by the number of weeks they spent at #1 on the chart, and ties are broken by the number of weeks they spent on the charts in total.</p>



<p>Every decade is represented since the Hot 100 came into existence with Bobby Darin's 1959 serial killer-inspired ballad "Mack the Knife" representing the oldest song on this list. Some songs on the list almost didn't come to pass. Beyoncé's breakthrough single "Irreplaceable," which became an anthem for female empowerment, was written by Ne-Yo from a male perspective and originally intended for country stars Shania Twain or Faith Hill. Others, like "Macarena" and Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" set off cultural phenomena that pushed celebrities and athletes to join the craze. Meanwhile, Mariah Carey is the only artist to have two songs make the top 10.</p>



<p>Some tunes represented here were misinterpreted upon release, such as The Police's "Every Breath You Take," which was thought to be a love song, but lead singer Sting revealed it was about stalking. Whatever your musical preference, the wide variety of songs that have ruled the Billboard Hot 100 charts will leave you humming a tune in your head.</p>



<p>Read on to find out which songs dominated Billboard's charts the longest.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">100. 'Billie Jean' by Michael Jackson</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 25<br>- Topped the charts from March 5, 1983, to April 16, 1983</p>



<p>The second single from Michael Jackson's iconic album "Thriller," "Billie Jean" and its music video became synonymous with the singer's iconic moonwalk dance. The unimaginable popularity that came from the freeze-frame video and the King of Pop's slick slide launched a movement that prompted MTV to integrate more Black musicians on its network rather than just white rock bands. The autobiographical song, about a woman who claimed Jackson fathered her child, won two Grammy awards, including Best R&amp;B Song and Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. "Billie Jean" continues to make headlines today,&nbsp;reaching an all-time high of #145 on Billboard's global charts in October 2024.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">99. 'Hot in Herre' by Nelly</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 26<br>- Topped the charts from June 29, 2002, to Aug. 10, 2002</p>



<p>This turn-of-the-century tune's classic first line ("I was like, good gracious/ a-- is bodacious") brought Nelly to overnight fame, winning him the Grammy for Best Male Rap Solo Performance in 2003. Nelly worked with the Neptunes on the hit, based on Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers' 1979 hit "Bustin' Loose." Fans streamed the song repeatedly in 2016 to help alleviate Nelly's $2.4 million tax lien.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">98. 'Black Beatles' by Rae Sremmurd (feat. Gucci Mane)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 27<br>- Topped the charts from Nov. 26, 2016, to Jan. 14, 2017</p>



<p>The Mannequin Challenge, the 2016 internet video trend where people posed still while playing "Black Beatles" in the background, pushed this hit straight to the top of the Billboard charts. Even Paul McCartney shared his attempt at the challenge to the song, writing on Instagram, "Love those Black Beatles."</p>



<p>In 2018, Forbes reported that "Black Beatles" had sold 6 million units in domestic sales and sales equivalents, which included streams, giving Rae Sremmurd six-time platinum status. In December 2024, the song joined YouTube's Billions Club, a collection of videos that have amassed over 1 billion views.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">97. 'Thank U, Next' by Ariana Grande</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 28<br>- Topped the charts from Nov. 17, 2018, to Jan. 5, 2019</p>



<p>In 2019, Ariana Grande admitted to Vogue that she doesn't remember recording "Thank U, Next" because she was dealing with alcohol abuse and depression following the September 2018 overdose of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller. Recorded a month after Miller's death, the empowering song lyrics, based on her past romantic relationships, won Grande Favorite Song at the 2019 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">96. 'Can't Help Falling in Love (from 'Sliver')' by UB40</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 29<br>- Topped the charts from July 24, 1993, to Sept. 4, 1993</p>



<p>The UB40 version of Elvis Presley's 1961 original hit song appeared on the soundtrack of "Sliver," a 1993 Sharon Stone film. As with the Presley remake, UB40 would later find success covering Neil Diamond's "Red Red Wine," which peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988. Though the English reggae band's debut hit "Food for Thought" gave them initial fame, their rendition of Presley's song gave them seven straight weeks at the top of America's music chart.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">95. 'Love the Way You Lie' by Eminem (feat. Rihanna)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 29<br>- Topped the charts from July 31, 2010, to Sept. 11, 2010</p>



<p>Off of Eminem's seventh album, "Recovery," "Love the Way You Lie" won notable awards, including Best Hip-Hop Song of the Year at the 2010 Soul Train Music Awards, Favorite Music Video and Favorite Song at the 2011 People's Choice Awards, and earned five Grammy nominations. Eminem reportedly collaborated with Rihanna on the hit since they both had experienced violent domestic relationships. The song has been remade by the View frontman Kyle Falconer (who has struggled with sobriety) and singer Alissa Janine.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kevin Winter // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">94. 'This Is How We Do It' by Montell Jordan</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 29<br>- Topped the charts from April 15, 1995, to May 27, 1995</p>



<p>In May 2019, Minister Montell Jordan switched up the lyrics to his original Def Jam Recordings hit about friends going to a club on the "American Idol" finale. Now a minister, Jordan cut out all the sex- and liquor-themed lyrics, which kept the original hit at #1 for seven weeks. Also the title of Jordan's first album, "This Is How We Do It" was nominated for the Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance Grammy in 1996, but "For Your Love" by Stevie Wonder took the prize.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Joan Adlen // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">93. 'Take a Bow' by Madonna</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 30<br>- Topped the charts from Feb. 25, 1995, to April 8, 1995</p>



<p>This Madonna and Babyface collaboration, recorded with a full orchestra, references the title "Take a Bow" in the first verse, but it's never mentioned again. Along with winning Best Female Video at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, the song was also featured in the Season 1 finale of the '90s hit television show "Friends," when Rachel realizes Ross loves her but is now with another woman.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kevin Winter // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">92. 'Whatever You Like' by T.I.</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 31<br>- Topped the charts from Sept. 6, 2008, to Nov. 8, 2008</p>



<p>Everybody liked T.I.'s "Whatever You Like"—produced by the famous Jim Jonsin, aka Jimmy J—so much that it broke the Billboard Hot 100 record in 2008, jumping from #71 to #1 in only a week. The song was included on T.I.'s album "Paper Trail," so named because he'd penned his lyrics "old-school style" with pen and paper rather than just rapping freestyle in the studio. "Whatever You Like" also became "Weird Al" Yankovic's only parody song to keep the same name as the original that inspired it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ben Rose/WireImage // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">91. 'Crank That (Soulja Boy)' by Soulja Boy</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 32<br>- Topped the charts from Sept. 15, 2007, to Nov. 3, 2007</p>



<p>Originally self-published on Soulja Boy's YouTube channel, "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" would later top the ringtone sales chart. Highsnobiety reported that the "digital age" track, perfect for 10-second splicing, created a craze in addition to holding the #1 spot for seven straight weeks. "He helped to bring back the trend of tying hit rap songs in with [easy-to-learn] dances, something that persists even now," Highsnobriety wrote.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">90. 'Umbrella' by Rihanna (feat. Jay-Z)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 34<br>- Topped the charts from June 9, 2007, to July 21, 2007</p>



<p>Winning the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration Grammy in 2008, "Umbrella" was reportedly not intended for Rihanna but for Britney Spears. And when the latter didn't want it, it was offered to Mary J. Blige, who also turned it down. Naturally, the Barbadian singer took the song to #1. According to The Guardian, the tune goes down as the 2007 Song of the Summer for nine specific reasons including "the little details, like the splashy hi-hat sound on the first beat of each bar, or the subtle double-tracked vocals on certain words of the chorus." "Umbrella" has remained an undisputed hit for more than a decade, earning a diamond certification in May 2024, while the music video joined YouTube's Billions Club in February 2024.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Steve Eichner // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">89. 'Waterfalls' by TLC</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 34<br>- Topped the charts from July 8, 1995, to Aug. 19, 1995</p>



<p>"Waterfalls" is not about cascading rain; it is about drug misuse and HIV. It was also the first song to reference the disease in its lyrics, according to HuffPost. TLC member Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas said the band was shocked when the hit beat Michael Jackson to become the first song by a Black artist to win the 1995 MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Michael Buckner // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">88. 'SexyBack' by Justin Timberlake</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 36<br>- Topped the charts from Sept. 9, 2006, to Oct. 21, 2006</p>



<p>Justin Timberlake told Entertainment Weekly he listened to David Bowie's "Rebel Rebel" 15 times the day before he penned "SexyBack," his first #1 Billboard Hot 100 single. "We really did want to make a statement at that time and do something just a little more bold," he said of the song, which debuted at #90 on the Billboard Hot 100 before reaching #1 for seven weeks straight. The song, a collaboration with rapper Timbaland, won the 2007 Grammy for Best Dance Recording.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Michael Stewart/WireImage // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">87. 'Blank Space' by Taylor Swift</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 38<br>- Topped the charts from Nov. 29, 2014, to Jan. 10, 2015</p>



<p>Taylor Swift set the bar as the first woman artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 to bump herself from the top of the charts, knocking "Shake It Off" from the top. Like many of Swift's song lyrics, "Blank Space" blurts out bad relationship details to a hip-hop beat. The song, which hit #1 after three weeks, is the third Swift hit—including "Shake It Off" and "We Are Never Getting Back Together"—she co-wrote with Max Martin and Shellback.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Peter Kramer // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">86. 'Goodies' by Ciara (feat. Petey Pablo)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 38<br>- Topped the charts from Sept. 11, 2004, to Oct. 23, 2004</p>



<p>Ciara wrote lyrics for singers Mya and Fantasia before topping the charts with her hit "Goodies." The song, with lyrics like "you won't get no nookie or the cookies" and "keep on lookin' cause they stay in the jar," makes one thing clear: No man—no matter what—is getting close to Ciara without her permission.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">85. 'Fancy' by Iggy Azalea (feat. Charli XCX)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 39<br>- Topped the charts from June 7, 2014, to July 19, 2014</p>



<p>With a music video inspired by the 1995 cult-classic film "Clueless" (which was even shot at Ulysses S. Grant High School in Los Angeles), "Fancy" was Iggy Azalea's first #1 hit in the U.S. Like the Beatles, the Australian rapper is the only other artist to have their first two Hot 100 hits concurrently ranked at #1 (for "Fancy")&nbsp;and #2 (for Ariana Grande's "Problem," which featured Azalea).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">84. 'Truth Hurts' by Lizzo</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 42<br>- Topped the charts from Sept. 7, 2019, to Oct. 26, 2019</p>



<p>While its popularity skyrocketed in 2019, "Truth Hurts" by Lizzo was released in September 2017. Lizzo is the sixth female rapper to top the Billboard Hot 100. She has since used her work and success to spread a message of confidence and encourage more opportunities for body-positive women of color in the music industry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Paras Griffin // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">83. 'Rockstar' by DaBaby (feat. Roddy Ricch)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 42<br>- Topped the charts from June 13, 2020, to Aug. 1, 2020</p>



<p>2017 was the year rap dethroned rock 'n' roll as the most-listened-to genre. Post Malone's nod to the dethroned genre led the way. This was the first #1 single for both Post Malone and 21 Savage, which was nominated for two Grammy awards, including Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance. After eight weeks at #1, "Rockstar" was bumped by Ed Sheeran's "Perfect."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Christopher Polk // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">82. 'Girls Like You' by Maroon 5 (feat. Cardi B)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 52<br>- Topped the charts from Sept. 29, 2018, to Nov. 10, 2018</p>



<p>Billboard detailed how this Maroon 5 and Cardi B collab reached a longevity milestone after spending 40 weeks in the top 20, a feat only accomplished five other times in the Hot 100's history. It also tied with Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" for the most weeks in the top 10, at 33. Featured on Maroon 5's sixth album, "Red Pill Blues," a reference to the red-pill-blue-pill concept from the 1999 science fiction epic "The Matrix."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">81. 'Stay' by The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 63<br>- Topped the charts from Aug. 14, 2021, to Oct. 16, 2021</p>



<p>After creating "Stay" with producers Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin, The Kid LAROI told NME that he felt Justin Bieber "would sound perfect" on the record. This instinct proved right, as the synth-pop anthem from LAROI and Bieber reached #1 on the Hot 100 in just four weeks, making "Stay" the first chart-topping single for LAROI and the eighth for Bieber. The track also marks the second collaboration between LAROI and Bieber, as the two singers previously joined forces in 2021 for the song "Unstable" on Bieber's sixth studio album, "Justice."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">80. 'Rolling in the Deep' by Adele</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 7<br>- Total weeks on chart: 65<br>- Topped the charts from May 21, 2011, to July 2, 2011</p>



<p>Adele described "Rolling in the Deep" as a "'gospel disco' kiss-off to an unfaithful dude." The slow southern sound of the song was inspired by contemporary Nashville music she listened to when touring the U.S. for her first album, "19," a genre she admittedly never studied before. After spending seven weeks at #1 between May and July, "Rolling in the Deep" was named Billboard's #1 Year-End Hot 100 single of 2011.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Richard E. Aaron/Redferns // Getty Images</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">79. 'Night Fever' by Bee Gees</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 8<br>- Total weeks on chart: 20<br>- Topped the charts from March 18, 1978, to May 6, 1978</p>



<p>The signature song for "Saturday Night Fever" was one of five written by the Bee Gees for the coming-of-age disco story that dominated pop culture in the late 1970s. Along with winning Album of the Year at the Grammys in 1979, the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack became part of the Library of Congress National Recording Registry in 2012. The rise and fall of the brother group, directly due to the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack, is recorded in the book "Staying Alive: The Disco Inferno of the Bee Gees."</p>

<p>This Rod Stewart classic quickly reached #1 after debuting at #81, making it the British rock singer's second Billboard hit off his "A Night on the Town" album. The song's meaning is clearly laid out in the lyrics: "C'mon, angel, my heart's on fire/ Don't deny your man's desire/ You'd be a fool to stop this tide/ Spread your wings and let me come inside." The BBC banned that last line before public demand lifted the boycott.</p>

Similar to the 1981 hit "Genius of Love," by Tom Tom Club, "Fantasy," a collaboration with Sean Combs, would become the second song to debut at #1, following Michael Jackson's "You Are Not Alone."

<p>Sampling Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's "My Favorite Things," Ariana Grande turned the classic "Sound of Music" tune into the true-life tale of how she bought seven rings for her friends when tipsy at Tiffany's after breaking up with her boyfriend. However, the song caused some strife with Soulja Boy, who tweeted, "You're a thief," accusing the singer of stealing the flow of his song "Pretty Boy Swag." Additionally, Grande apologized to fans for misusing the word "weave" in her song, which also ruffled some feathers.</p>

<p>In 2017, rap music made serious noise after dethroning rock 'n' roll as the most-listened-to genre. Post Malone's nod to the ousted genre led the way. This was the first #1 single for both Post Malone and 21 Savage, which earned Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance nominations at the Grammys. "Rockstar" spent eight weeks at #1 before it was bumped by Ed Sheeran's "Perfect."</p>

<p>Long before singer Meghan Trainor wrote "All About That Bass" with producer Kevin Kadish, the pop star was penning lyrics for artists like Rascal Flatts. The song—more about the booty than the bass—is a self-acceptance anthem, according to Trainor, who told Billboard it is even for skinny girls despite the lyrical misinterpretation. Trainor's first hit single, which held the #1 spot for eight weeks, was nominated for Record of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards but lost to "Stay with Me" by Sam Smith.</p>

<p>In the synth-pop lead single from her 10th studio album, "Midnights," Taylor Swift repeatedly declares "Hi, it's me. I'm the problem. It's me." This makes "Anti-Hero" one of the most self-critical and candid songs in Swift's massive catalog, garnering respect from both critics and fans and landing her a long-running stint on the Hot 100. "Anti-Hero" stayed atop the chart for a week longer than "Blank Space."</p>

"Flowers" also became the singer's second #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 after "Wrecking Ball" in 2013. Listeners have long speculated that the track may be about Cyrus' ex-husband, Liam Hemsworth.

<p>50 Cent's third #1 Billboard single, "Candy Shop," has nothing to do with sweets—it's all about sex. Billboard reported in 2005 that the hit bumped the nine-week #1 song "Let Me Love You' by Mario, noting, "50 Cent can't rest easy on top of the Hot 100, as Green Day's 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' continues to push skyward, making a 3-2 move this week."

<p>Where can you find 50 Cent? "You can find me in a club, bottle full of bub," is the opening line to the famous rapper's biggest Billboard hit. Co-written by Dr. Dre and Mike Elizondo, "In Da Club," faced an infringement lawsuit in 2006 by copyright owner Joseph Weinberger, who alleged 50 Cent stole the line "It's your birthday" from the Luther Campbell song of the same title.

<p>Singer André 3000 told HuffPost all about "Hey Ya!" on its 10th anniversary, saying it had several working titles and isn't autobiographical. What's real is the song was inspired by the Ramones, the Smiths, and the Buzzcocks, three artists the rapper was listening to "heavily" before he wrote it. As for the famous line "Shake it like a Polaroid picture," André admits you're actually not supposed to shake the film, but it sounded good while writing the lyrics.</p>

A completely random phone call from Diddy to Kesha's producer, Dr. Luke (Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald), a few hours later led the music mogul to contribute a couple of lines to the song.</p>



<p>"TiK ToK" dominated digital sales in 2010, with 12.9 million downloads, 3 million more than Lady Gaga's "Poker Face." Four years later, in 2014, Kesha filed a lawsuit accusing Dr. Luke of sexual assault among other things, spurring a brutal legal battle between the singer and her mother, Dr. Luke, and Sony.

"Royals" was written as a sort of diss track against the lavish lifestyle and excesses of many pop stars but got its title when Lorde saw a picture of Kansas City Royals star George Brett in a magazine.

<p>"Physical" was released just one week after MTV went on the air, making it one of the first videos to replay on the new station. Unassuming Australian singer Olivia Newton-John had concerns about singing the song, which was originally written for Rod Stewart, so the video was created as a distraction from the fact that the song was about sex. Her worry was for naught: "Physical" won the Grammy for Video of the Year in 1982.</p>

<p>- Weeks at #1: 16<br>- Total weeks on chart: 27<br>- Topped the charts from Dec. 2, 1995, to March 16, 1996</p>



<p>The death of Boyz II Men's manager Khalil Rountree in a shooting prompted member Nathan Morris to write a tribute song to their "father figure." After receiving a call from Carey's manager about a potential collaboration, the two got together and found they were penning similar songs. They merged the two and produced a 16-week reign atop the charts that stood alone for over 21 years.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. 'Despacito' by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee (feat. Justin Bieber)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 16<br>- Total weeks on chart: 51<br>- Topped the charts from May 27, 2017, to Sept. 9, 2017</p>



<p>The Spanish-language hit set off a dance and meme craze in 2017, becoming the most-viewed video in YouTube history at the time, with over six billion clicks. Justin Bieber got involved after seeing the reaction to the song in a club while in Colombia, prompting a call to Luis Fonsi. The collaboration did not win a single Grammy Award despite its worldwide mega-success, losing out to Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in one of the biggest snubs of all time.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. 'Last Night' by Morgan Wallen</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 16<br>- Total weeks on chart: 60<br>- Topped the charts from March 18, 2023, to Aug. 19, 2023</p>



<p>Country singer Morgan Wallen scored his first #1 on the Hot 100 chart with "Last Night," the third single from his third studio album, "One Thing at a Time." Telling the story of a drunken fight between a couple, this genre-bending crossover track helped make Wallen a recognizable name outside of Nashville and the country scene. With 16 weeks on top, "Last Night" also beat out Harry Styles' "As It Was" to earn the longest #1 run for a noncollaboration—before Shaboozey's "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" entered the chart.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. 'A Bar Song (Tipsy)' by Shaboozey</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 19<br>- Total weeks on chart: 34<br>- Topped the charts from July 13, 2024, to Nov. 30, 2024</p>



<p>While "everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy," they'll likely hear Shaboozey's "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" at least once during the night. This sing-along country-pop track is the fourth single from Shaboozey's third album, "Where I've Been, Isn't Where I'm Going," and catapulted the country singer into mainstream popularity. "A Bar Song" spent a record-tying 19 weeks atop the Hot 100 chart before being knocked down by West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar's 2024 single "squabble up."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. 'Old Town Road' by Lil Nas X (feat. Billy Ray Cyrus)</h3>



<p>- Weeks at #1: 19<br>- Total weeks on chart: 45<br>- Topped the charts from April 13, 2019, to Aug. 17, 2019</p>



<p>"Old Town Road" took a rare, organic rise to the top, as Lil Nas X released the original version on the video-sharing app TikTok in December 2018. A crossover between rap and country music he calls "country trap," Lil Nas X bought the beat for just $30 from YoungKio. Billy Ray Cyrus was brought in for the remix after Billboard controversially dropped the song from the country charts over a genre debate. The remix and accompanying long-form video propelled the song to the longest-running #1 of all time.</p>
