<p>PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — They came from every walk of life to make ours better, richer, more rounded. They were Oscar winners in front of and behind the camera. Legendary journalists, rock stars, country stars, Deadheads.</p>



<p>They were comedians, politicians, firebrands, scientists. There were athletes, famous and infamous. An astronaut, a sex therapist, and a fitness guru. Game show hosts and talk show hosts. Humanitarians, World War II heroes, and poets.</p>



<p>Here's a look at those we lost in 2024.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">January 2024</h3>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Glynis Johns, January 4, 2024</strong>: A Tony Award-winning stage and screen star, Johns played the mother opposite Julie Andrews in the classic movie “Mary Poppins” and introduced the world to the bittersweet standard-to-be “Send in the Clowns” by Stephen Sondheim, died. She was 100.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>David Soul, January 4: </strong>Actor-singer David Soul, a 1970s heartthrob who co-starred as the blond half of the crime-fighting duo “Starsky &amp; Hutch” and topped the music charts with the ballad “Don’t Give Up on Us,” died at the age of 80. Soul portrayed detective Ken “Hutch” Hutchinson alongside dark-haired Paul Michael Glaser as detective David Starsky in “Starsky &amp; Hutch, which ran on ABC from 1975 to 1979 and grew so popular it spawned a line of children’s toys.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Joyce Randolph, January 14: </strong>Joyce Randolph, a veteran stage and television actress whose role as the savvy Trixie Norton on “The Honeymooners” provided the perfect foil to her dimwitted TV husband, died at 99. She was the last surviving main character of the beloved comedy from television’s golden age of the 1950s. After five years as a member of Gleason’s on-the-air repertory company, Randolph virtually retired, opting to focus full-time on marriage and motherhood.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Norman Jewison, January 20:</strong> Norman Jewison, the acclaimed and versatile Canadian-born director whose Hollywood films ranged from Doris Day comedies and “Moonstruck” to social dramas such as the Oscar-winning “In the Heat of the Night,” died at age 97. Jewison was a three-time Oscar nominee who in 1999 received an Academy Award for lifetime achievement.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Dexter Scott King, January 22: </strong>Dexter Scott King, who dedicated much of his life to shepherding the civil rights legacy of his parents, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, died after battling prostate cancer. He was 62.

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Charles Osgood, January 23:</strong> Charles Osgood, a five-time Emmy Award-winning journalist who anchored “CBS Sunday Morning” for more than two decades, hosted the long-running radio program “The Osgood File” and was referred to as CBS News’ poet-in-residence, died at 91 of dementia. Osgood was an erudite, warm broadcaster with a flair for music who could write essays and light verse as well as report hard news. He worked radio and television with equal facility, and signed off by telling listeners: “I’ll see you on the radio.”</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Chita Rivera, January 30:</strong> Chita Rivera, the dynamic dancer, singer and actor who garnered 10 Tony nominations, winning twice, in a long Broadway career that forged a path for Latina artists and shrugged off a near-fatal car accident, died at 91. Rivera first gained wide notice in 1957 as Anita in the original production of “West Side Story” and was still dancing on Broadway with her trademark energy a half-century later in 2015’s “The Visit.” In August 2009, Rivera was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the U.S. can give a civilian.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Carl Weathers, January 30:</strong> A former NFL linebacker who became a Hollywood action movie and comedy star, he played nemesis-turned-ally Apollo Creed in the “Rocky” movies, faced off against Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Predator” and taught golf in “Happy Gilmore.” Most recently, Weathers starred in the Disney+ hit “The Mandalorian,” appearing in all three seasons. He died in his sleep at 76. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">February 2024</h3>

</p>

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Wayne Kramer, February 2: </strong>Wayne Kramer, the co-founder of the protopunk Detroit band the MC5 that thrashed out such hardcore anthems as “Kick Out the Jams” and influenced everyone from the Clash to Rage Against the Machine, died of pancreatic cancer. He was 75. The band had little commercial success and its core lineup did not last beyond the early 1970s, but its legacy endured, both for its sound and for its fusing of music to political action. Kramer, who had a long history of legal battles and substance abuse, would tell his story in the 2018 memoir “The Hard Stuff: Dope, Crime, the MC5, and My Life of Impossibilities.”</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Toby Keith, February 5:</strong> Toby Keith, the country singer who immortalized the humble plastic cups in his 2011 hit “Red Solo Cup," died of stomach cancer at age 62. “Red Solo Cup” was featured on Keith’s 2011 album “Clancy’s Tavern.” Keith didn’t write the song, and in a 2014 interview, he said he wasn’t even sure he would release it. But whenever he played it, he noticed people would start singing along almost immediately. “It is the stupidest song I ever heard in my life, but it’s so stupid it’s good,” Keith told The Boot at the time.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Bob Edwards, February 10: </strong>Bob Edwards, who anchored National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition” for just under 25 years and was the baritone voice who told many Americans what had happened while they slept, died at age 76. He became co-host of “All Things Considered” with Susan Stamberg in 1974 shortly after joining NPR, and was the founding anchor of “Morning Edition” in 1979. He left NPR after being replaced on the show in 2004 — a programming move that led to protests by thousands of listeners — and he joined SiriusXM satellite radio.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Alexei Navalny, February 16: </strong>Alexei Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony where he was serving a 19-year sentence. He was 47. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. He was later convicted three times, saying each case was politically motivated. After the last verdict, Navalny said he understood he was “serving a life sentence, which is measured by the length of my life or the length of life of this regime.”</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Richard Lewis, February 27:</strong> Richard Lewis, an acclaimed comedian known for exploring his neuroses in frantic, stream-of-consciousness diatribes while dressed in all-black, leading to his nickname “The Prince of Pain,” died of a heart attack at age 76. He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2023. Comedy Central named Lewis one of the top 50 stand-up comedians of all time and he earned a berth in GQ magazine’s list of the “20th Century’s Most Influential Humorists.” He lent his humor to charity causes, including Comic Relief and Comedy Gives Back.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Brian Mulroney, February 29:</strong> Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who forged close ties with two Republican U.S. presidents through a sweeping free trade agreement that was once vilified but is now celebrated, died at 84. Leader of the Progressive Conservative party from 1983 to 1993, Mulroney served almost a decade as prime minister after he was first elected in 1984 after snagging the largest majority in Canadian history with 211 of 282 seats.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">March 2024</h3>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Chris Mortensen, March 3</strong>: Chris Mortensen, the award-winning journalist who covered the NFL for close to four decades, including 32 as a senior analyst at ESPN, died at 72. Mortensen announced in 2016 that he had been diagnosed with Stage IV throat cancer. Even while undergoing treatment, he was the first to confirm the retirement of Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning. Mortensen joined ESPN in 1991, and for years helped shape the network’s coverage as the NFL exploded into year-round coverage.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>

</p>

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>M. Emmet Walsh, March 19:</strong> M. Emmet Walsh, the character actor who brought his unmistakable face and unsettling presence to films including “Blood Simple” and “Blade Runner,” died at age 88.

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Joe Lieberman, March 27:</strong> Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut senator who became the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate of a major party when Al Gore selected him as his running mate in the 2000 election, died at age 82 after suffering complications from a fall. His independent streak factored into Gore’s decision to select him as a running mate, which enabled the then-vice president to put some distance between himself and the scandals of the Clinton administration. Despite his differences with fellow Democrats, Lieberman was highly respected within the Senate for his high integrity and pragmatism.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Louis Gossett Jr., March 29:</strong> Louis Gossett Jr., the first Black man to win a supporting actor Oscar and an Emmy winner for his role in the seminal TV miniseries “Roots,” died.

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>

Born in Pittsburgh, he spent seven years at The Second City in Chicago before moving north of the border to help establish the theater’s Toronto outpost.

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>John Sinclair, April 2: J</strong>ohn Sinclair, a poet, music producer and counterculture figure whose lengthy prison sentence after a series of small-time pot busts inspired a John Lennon song and a star-studded 1971 concert to free him, died. He was 82. Sinclair drew a 9 1/2-to-10-year prison sentence in 1969 from Detroit Recorder’s Court Judge Robert Colombo for giving two joints to undercover officers. He served 29 months but was released a few days after Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger, and others performed in front of 15,000 attendees at the University of Michigan’s Crisler Arena. “They gave him 10 for two/What else can Judge Colombo do/We gotta set him free,” Lennon sang in “John Sinclair,” a song the ex-Beatle wrote that immortalized its subject.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Peter Higgs, April 9:</strong> Nobel prize-winning physicist Peter Higgs, who proposed the existence of the so-called “God particle” that helped explain how matter formed after the Big Bang, died at age 94. Higgs predicted the existence of a new particle, which came to be known as the Higgs boson, in 1964. He theorized there must be a subatomic particle of certain dimension that would explain how other particles — and therefore all the stars and planets in the universe — acquired mass. Without something like this particle, the set of equations physicists use to describe the world, known as the standard model, would not hold together.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>OJ Simpson, April 11:</strong> OJ Simpson, the NFL Hall of Fame running back and TV sportscaster who will forever be remembered as the accused killer of his ex-wife and her friend in 1994, died of prostate cancer at the age of 76. His death came just a few months before the 30th anniversary of the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Attorney Gloria Allred, who once represented Nicole’s family, told ABC News: “I feel that the system failed Nicole Brown Simpson and failed battered women everywhere. I don’t mourn for O.J. Simpson. I do mourn for Nicole Brown Simpson and her family and they should be remembered.”</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Robert MacNeil, April 12:</strong> Robert MacNeil, who created the even-handed, no-frills PBS newscast “The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour” in the 1970s and co-anchored the show for with his late partner, Jim Lehrer, for two decades, died at 93. MacNeil first gained prominence for his coverage of the Senate Watergate hearings for the public broadcasting service and began his half-hour “Robert MacNeil Report” on PBS in 1975 with his friend Lehrer as Washington correspondent. The broadcast became the “MacNeil-Lehrer Report” and then, in 1983, was expanded to an hour and renamed the “MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.”</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Whitey Herzog, April 15:</strong> Whitey Herzog, the gruff and ingenious Hall of Fame manager who guided the St. Louis Cardinals to three pennants and a World Series title in the 1980s and perfected an intricate, nail-biting strategy known as “Whiteyball,” died. He was 92. A crew-cut, pot-bellied tobacco chewer who had no patience for the “buddy-buddy” school of management, Herzog joined the Cardinals in 1980 and helped end the team’s decade-plus pennant drought by adapting it to the artificial surface and distant fences of Busch Memorial Stadium.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Bob Graham, April 16: </strong>Former U.S. Sen. and two-term Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, died at 87. Graham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion. Graham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the “workdays” political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched, and even his golf scores</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Dickey Betts, April 18:</strong> Dickey Betts, who left home at 16 to join the circus and became a renowned guitarist touring the world with the Allman Brothers Band, died at 80 from cancer. He wrote the group’s biggest hit, “Ramblin’ Man,” and remained on the road until he reached the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Betts shared lead guitar duties with Duane Allman in the original Allman Brothers Band to help give the group its unique sound and create a new genre, Southern rock. The band blended blues, country, R&amp;B and jazz with ’60s rock to produce a distinct sound that influenced a host of major acts, including Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, Phish, Jason Isbell and Chris Stapleton, among many others.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Terry Anderson, April 21:</strong> Terry Anderson, the globe-trotting Associated Press correspondent who became one of America’s longest-held hostages after he was snatched from a street in war-torn Lebanon in 1985 and held for nearly seven years, died at 76. After returning to the United States in 1991, Anderson led a peripatetic life, giving public speeches, teaching journalism at several prominent universities and, at various times, operating a blues bar, Cajun restaurant, horse ranch and gourmet restaurant. He also struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, won millions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets after a federal court concluded that country played a role in his capture, then lost most of it to bad investments.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>William Calley, April 28</strong>: William Laws Calley Jr., who as an Army lieutenant led the U.S. soldiers who killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in the My Lai massacre, the most notorious war crime in modern American military history, died. He was 80. Calley had been living in an apartment in Gainesville. His death was first reported by The Washington Post on July 29, 2024, citing his death certificate. On March 16, 1968, Calley led American soldiers of the Charlie Company on a mission to confront a crack outfit of Vietcong enemies. Instead, over several hours, the soldiers killed 504 unresisting civilians, mostly women, children and elderly men, in My Lai and a neighboring community. Calley was convicted in 1971 for the murders of 22 people during the rampage. He was sentenced to life in prison but served only three days because President Richard Nixon ordered his sentence reduced. He served three years of house arrest.</p>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Duane Eddy, April 30:</strong> Duane Eddy, a pioneering guitar hero whose reverberating electric sound on instrumentals such as “Rebel Rouser” and “Peter Gunn” helped put the twang in early rock ‘n’ roll and influenced George Harrison, Bruce Springsteen and countless other musicians, died of cancer at age 86. With his raucous rhythms, and backing hollers and hand claps, Eddy sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and mastered a distinctive sound based on the premise that a guitar’s bass strings sounded better on tape than the high ones.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">May</h3>


<p class="wp-block-image">
</p>


<p><strong>Bernard Hill, May 5: </strong>Bernard Hill, well-known for his roles in “Titanic” and the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy died at 79. His most notable roles were as Captain Edward Smith in the 1997 film “Titanic” and as King Théoden in the “Lord of the Rings.” Hill also appeared in the 1999 film “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and “Valkyrie,” a 2008 Tom Cruise film. In addition to “The Responder,” Hill’s more recent roles were in “The Moor” and “Forever Young,” both of which were released last year.</p>

He was 93. The center fielder was baseball’s oldest living Hall of Famer. His signature basket catch and his dashes around the bases with his cap flying off personified the joy of the game. His over-the shoulder catch of a long drive in the 1954 World Series is baseball’s most celebrated defensive feat. Over 22 seasons, virtually all with the New York/San Francisco Giants, Mays batted .302, hit 660 home runs, totaled 3,283 hits, scored more than 2,000 runs and won 12 Gold Gloves.

His breakthrough was “The Dirty Dozen” (1967), in which he played Vernon Pinkley, the officer-impersonating psychopath. 1970 saw the release of the World War II yarn “Kelly’s Heroes” and “M.A.S.H.,” a smash hit that catapulted Sutherland to stardom.</p>

<p><strong>Shelley Duvall, July 11:</strong> Shelley Duvall, the intrepid, Texas-born movie star whose wide-eyed, winsome presence was a mainstay in the films of Robert Altman and who co-starred in Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” died from complications of diabetes at the age of 75. Duvall, gaunt and gawky, was no conventional Hollywood starlet. But she had a beguilingly frank manner and exuded a singular naturalism. The film critic Pauline Kael called her the “female Buster Keaton.” At her peak, Duvall was a regular star in some of the defining movies of the 1970s. In “The Shining” (1980), she played Wendy Torrance, who watches in horror as her husband, Jack (Jack Nicholson), goes crazy while their family is isolated in the Overlook Hotel. It was Duvall’s screaming face that made up half of the film’s most iconic image, along with Jack’s axe coming through the door.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Ruth Westheimer, July 12</strong>: Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the diminutive sex therapist who became a pop icon, media star and best-selling author through her frank talk about once-taboo bedroom topics, died. She was 96. “I still hold old-fashioned values and I’m a bit of a square,” she told students at Michigan City High School in 2002. “Sex is a private art and a private matter. But still, it is a subject we must talk about.” Westheimer’s giggly, German-accented voice, coupled with her 4-foot-7 frame, made her an unlikely looking — and sounding — outlet for “sexual literacy.” The contradiction was one of the keys to her success. She soon became a regular on the late-night television talk-show circuit, bringing her personality to the national stage. Her rise coincided with the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when frank sexual talk became a necessity.</p>

Newhart, best remembered now as the star of two hit television shows of the 1970s and 1980s, launched his career as a stand-up comic in the late 1950s. Newhart was an anomaly. His outlook was modern, but he rarely raised his voice above a hesitant, almost stammering delivery.

He was 88. Dubbed “the king of daytime talk,” Donahue was the first to incorporate audience participation in a talk show, typically during a full hour with a single guest. The format set “The Phil Donahue Show” apart from other interview shows of the 1960s and made it a trendsetter in daytime television, where it was particularly popular with female audiences. The show was syndicated in 1970 and ran on national television for the next 26 years, racking up 20 Emmy Awards for the show and for Donahue as host, as well as a Peabody for Donahue in 1980. In May, President Joe Biden awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom to Donahue, who was cited as a pioneer of the daytime talk show.</p>

<p><strong>Linda Deutsch, September 1</strong>: Linda Deutsch, a special correspondent for The Associated Press who for nearly 50 years wrote glittering first drafts of history from many of the nation’s most significant criminal and civil trials — Charles Manson, O.J. Simpson, Michael Jackson, among others — died at the age of 80. One of America’s best-known trial reporters when she retired in 2015, Deutsch’s courts career began with the 1969 trial and conviction of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. She went on to cover a who’s who of criminal defendants — Manson, Simpson, Jackson, Patty Hearst, Phil Spector, the Menendez Brothers, “Night Stalker” Richard Ramirez, “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski and the police officers charged in the beating of motorist Rodney King. She was in a Los Angeles courtroom in 1995 for the conclusion of “The Trial of the Century” that saw Simpson, an NFL Hall of Famer, acquitted of killing his ex-wife and her friend. Thirteen years later, Deutsch was in a Las Vegas courtroom when Simpson was convicted of kidnapping and robbery and sentenced to prison. Her work, always written with verve, was not limited to celebrity — other trials involved fraud, conspiracy, environmental disasters and immigration — and eventually earned her the title of special correspondent, the most prestigious byline for an AP reporter.</p>

He was also given an honorary Oscar and a special Tony for lifetime achievement. In 2022, a Broadway theater was renamed in his honor. He was also a sought-after voice actor, expressing the villainy of Darth Vader (“No, I am your father,” commonly misremembered as “Luke, I am your father”), as well as the benign dignity of King Mufasa in both the 1994 and 2019 versions of Disney’s “The Lion King” and announcing “This is CNN” during station breaks. He won a 1977 Grammy for his performance on the “Great American Documents” audiobook.</p>

He was 93. Hired by union executive director Marvin Miller as general counsel in 1967, Moss argued the 1975 case involving pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally that led to arbitrator Peter Seitz striking down the reserve clause. That provision for a unilateral one-year renewal had been included in every contract since 1878 and had enabled teams to control players by maintaining those agreements could be extended perpetually. Moss quit the union in July 1977 to become an agent, and his clients included future Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan, Jack Morris and Gary Carter.</p>

<p><strong>Pete Rose, September 30: </strong>Pete Rose, baseball’s career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, died at 83. For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. No milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Commissioner Bart Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction.</p>

<p><strong>Luis Tiant, October 8</strong>: Luis Tiant, the charismatic Cuban with a horseshoe mustache and mesmerizing windup who pitched the Red Sox to the brink of a World Series championship and pitched himself to the doorstep of the baseball Hall of Fame, died at his home in Maine. He was 83. With a swaggering style and an iconic wiggling windup that froze batters in the box, “El Tiante” was a three-time All-Star and four-time 20-game winner whose greatest individual season came with Cleveland in 1968, when he went 21-9 with 19 complete games and nine shutouts — four of them in a row.

<p><strong>Ethel Kennedy, October 10:</strong> Ethel Kennedy, the wife of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who raised their 11 children after he was assassinated and remained dedicated to social causes and the family’s legacy for decades thereafter, died at the age of 96. President Joe Biden called her “an American icon — a matriarch of optimism and moral courage, an emblem of resilience and service.” The Kennedy matriarch, mother to Kathleen, Joseph II, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas and Rory, was one of the last remaining members of a family generation that included President John F. Kennedy. Ethel Kennedy founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights soon after her husband’s death and advocated for causes including gun control and human rights. She rarely spoke about her husband’s assassination. When her filmmaker daughter Rory brought it up in the 2012 HBO documentary, “Ethel,” she couldn’t share her grief.</p>

<p><strong>Lilly Ledbetter, October 12: </strong>Lilly Ledbetter, a former Alabama factory manager whose lawsuit against her employer made her an icon of the equal pay movement and led to landmark wage discrimination legislation, died at 86. Ledbetter’s discovery that she was earning less than her male counterparts for doing the same job at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. plant in Alabama led to her lawsuit, which ultimately failed when the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had filed her complaint too late. The court ruled that workers must file lawsuits within six months of first receiving a discriminatory paycheck — in Ledbetter’s case, years before she learned about the disparity through an anonymous letter. Two years later, former President Barack Obama signed into the law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave workers the right to sue within 180 days of receiving each discriminatory paycheck, not just the first one. “Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work,” Obama said in a statement. “Lilly did what so many Americans before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even higher for her children and grandchildren.”</p>

<p><strong>Liam Payne, October 16:</strong> Former One Direction singer Liam Payne, 31, whose chart-topping British boy band generated a global following of swooning fans, was found dead after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Payne had been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series “The X Factor” in 2010, two years after Payne’s first attempt to get on the show. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands — even though they lost the competition.</p>

<p><strong>John Kinsel Sr., October 19:</strong> John Kinsel Sr., one of the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages during World War II based on the tribe’s native language, died at the age of 107. With Kinsel’s death, only two original Navajo Code Talkers are still alive. Hundreds of Navajos were recruited by the Marines to serve as Code Talkers during the war, transmitting messages based on their then-unwritten native language. The Code Talkers sent thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war’s ultimate outcome. They confounded Japanese military cryptologists during World War II and participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, including at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo Jima. Kinsel enlisted in the Marines in 1942 and became an elite Code Talker, serving with the 9th Marine Regiment and the 3rd Marine Division during the Battle of Iwo Jima.</p>

<p><strong>Phil Lesh, October 25: </strong>Phil Lesh, a classically trained violinist and jazz trumpeter who found his true calling reinventing the role of rock bass guitar as a founding member of the Grateful Dead, died at age 84. Although he kept a relatively low public profile, rarely granting interviews or speaking to the audience, fans and fellow band members recognized Lesh as a critical member of the Grateful Dead whose thundering lines on the six-string electric bass provided a brilliant counterpoint to lead guitarist Jerry Garcia’s soaring solos and anchored the band’s famous marathon jams. He took part in a 2009 Grateful Dead tour and again in 2015 for a handful of “Fare Thee Well” concerts marking both the band’s 50th anniversary and what Lesh said would be the last time he would play with the others.</p>

<p><strong>Terri Garr, October 29: </strong>Teri Garr, the quirky comedy actor who rose from background dancer in Elvis Presley movies to co-star of such favorites as “Young Frankenstein” and “Tootsie,” died of multiple sclerosis. She was 79. Her big film break came as Gene Hackman’s girlfriend in 1974’s Francis Ford Coppola thriller “The Conversation.” That led to an interview with Mel Brooks, who said he would hire her for the role of Gene Wilder’s German lab assistant in 1974’s “Young Frankenstein” — if she could speak with a German accent. Her big smile and off-center appeal helped land her roles in “Oh, God!” opposite George Burns and John Denver, “Mr. Mom” (as Michael Keaton’s wife) and “Tootsie” in which she played the girlfriend who loses Dustin Hoffman to Jessica Lange and learns that he has dressed up as a woman to revive his career. (She also lost the supporting actress Oscar at that year’s Academy Awards to Lange.)</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Allison, November 9</strong>: Bobby Allison, founder of racing’s “Alabama Gang” and a NASCAR Hall of Famer, died. He was 86. “Bobby was the ultimate fan’s driver,” Allison’s family said in a statement. He helped put NASCAR on the map with more than his driving. His infamous fight with Cale Yarborough in the closing laps of the 1979 Daytona 500 served as one of the sport’s defining moments. Allison retired in 1988 following a crash that nearly killed him. In June 1987, he wrecked on the opening lap at Talledega Superspeedway. He hit the outside wall and then got T-boned in the driver’s side door. He was initially declared dead upon reaching a local hospital but was later resuscitated.</p>
