<p>LOS ANGELES (NEXSTAR) - The two biggest fires devastating the Los Angeles area grew just slightly Friday as firefighters beat back the blazes that have killed at least 10 people, obliterated neighborhoods and left the nation's second-largest city on edge.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>Officials expressed optimism&nbsp;that a break from the punishing winds stoking the flames will allow firefighters to make headway on the fires that have burned an area bigger than San Francisco and destroyed more than 10,000 homes and other structures since Tuesday.</p>



<p>“These fires are not out, though today we’re going to make a lot of progress,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday.</p>

<p>Metropolitan LA and its 13 million residents, who&nbsp;haven't seen rain in more than eight months, woke up Friday to another day of strong winds and the threat of new flareups. The gusts were expected to diminish by evening, however, and already have died down from earlier in the week, when hurricane-force winds&nbsp;blew embers&nbsp;that ignited hillsides.</p>



<p>But meteorologist Rich Thompson warned the break could be short-lived.</p>



<p>“We’re looking for a little respite on Friday and Saturday from the Santa Ana winds but then they’re going to pick up again Sunday through most of next week,” he said Thursday evening.</p>



<p>LA Mayor Karen Bass said Friday morning that firefighters had contained several smaller fires in the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>On Thursday afternoon,&nbsp;the Kenneth Fire started&nbsp;in the San Fernando Valley near a school serving as a shelter for evacuees from another fire. It moved into neighboring Ventura County, but a large and aggressive response by firefighters stopped the flames from spreading.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;level of devastation is jarring&nbsp;even in a state that has grown used to massive wildfires. Dozens of blocks of scenic Pacific Palisades were flattened to smoldering rubble. In neighboring Malibu, where oceanfront homes once stood, all that was left above the debris were blackened palm strands.</p>



<p>Robert Lara sifted through the remains of his home in Altadena, next to Pasadena, on Thursday with tears in his eyes, hoping to find a safe with a set of earrings that once belonged to his great-great-grandmother.</p>



<p>“All our memories, all our sentimental attachments, things that were gifted from generation to generation to generation are now gone,” he said.</p>



<p>No cause&nbsp;has been identified for the largest fires.</p>



<p>A firefighting plane had to be grounded Thursday after it was struck by a drone flown by a civilian, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Nobody was injured. It’s a federal crime to fly a drone during firefighting.</p>



<p>Firefighters for the first time have made progress containing the Eaton Fire north of Pasadena, officials said Friday. It started Tuesday night and has burned more than 5,000 structures, a term that includes homes, apartment buildings, businesses, outbuildings and vehicles.</p>



<p>To the west, the fire in Pacific Palisades, the largest burning in the LA area, has destroyed over 5,300 structures. The blaze is already the most destructive in Los Angeles’ history.</p>



<p>At least five churches, a synagogue, seven schools, two libraries, boutiques, bars, restaurants, banks and groceries have been burned. So too were the Will Rogers’ Western Ranch House and Topanga Ranch Motel,&nbsp;local landmarks&nbsp;dating to the 1920s.</p>



<p>The government has not yet released figures on the cost of the damage. AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, on Thursday increased its estimate of the damage and economic loss to $135-$150 billion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Returning to what’s left</h3>



<p>Bridget Berg, who watched her home in Altadena erupt in flames live on TV while she was at work, came back with her family on Thursday “just to make it real.”</p>



<p>They searched through charred debris of the house they bought 16 years ago, finding pieces of pottery, petrified wood and Japanese wood block prints handed down by a grandmother.</p>



<p>“It’s not like we just lost our house,” she said. “Everybody lost their house.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The enormity of the destruction emerges</h3>



<p>Right now, it’s impossible to quantify the extent of the destruction other than “total devastation and loss,” said Barbara Bruderlin, head of the Malibu Pacific Palisades Chamber of Commerce.</p>



<p>“There are areas where everything is gone, there isn’t even a stick of wood left, it’s just dirt,” Bruderlin said.</p>



<p>Of the 10 deaths so far, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley confirmed two were in the Palisades Fire. County officials said the Eaton Fire had killed five.</p>



<p>Two of the dead were Anthony Mitchell, a 67-year-old amputee, and his son, Justin, who had cerebral palsy. They were waiting for an ambulance to come and did not make it to safety when the flames roared through, Mitchell’s daughter, Hajime White, told The Washington Post.</p>



<p>Shari Shaw told&nbsp;KTLA&nbsp;that she tried to get her 66-year-old brother, Victor Shaw, to evacuate Tuesday night but he wanted to stay and fight the fire. Crews found his body with a garden hose in his hand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">California is seeing a longer fire season</h3>



<p>California’s wildfire season is beginning earlier and ending later due to rising temperatures and decreased rainfall tied to climate change, according to recent data. Several weather monitoring agencies announced Friday that&nbsp;Earth recorded its hottest year ever in 2024.</p>



<p>Dry winds, including&nbsp;the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, which has not seen more than 0.1 inches (2.5 millimeters) of rain since early May.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Evacuations, school closures and arrests</h3>



<p>Roughly 150,000 people remained under evacuation orders, and the fires have consumed about 56 square miles (145 square kilometers), larger than the size of San Francisco.</p>



<p>All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second largest, will be closed again Friday because of the heavy smoke wafting over the city and ash raining down in parts.</p>



<p>California National Guard troops arrived on the streets of Altadena before dawn Friday to help protect property in the fire evacuation zone and evening curfews were set to begin in those areas to prevent looting after several earlier arrests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Actors among those who lost homes</h3>



<p>Many celebrities live in areas devastated by fire.&nbsp;Among those who lost their homes&nbsp;were Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Paris Hilton.</p>



<p>Actor Steve Guttenberg&nbsp;said his Pacific Palisades home was miraculously spared but found his once-picturesque neighborhood charred and unrecognizable. He returned to help with relief efforts.</p>



<p>“There’s really a lot of pain going on right now," he said. "I’m doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.”</p>
