<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday that a ceasefire agreement with Hamas is still not complete and the final details are being worked out.</p>


<p>Netanyahu's statement comes hours after the United States and Qatar announced the deal, which would pause the devastating 15-month war in Gaza and clear the way for dozens of hostages to go home. The conflict has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.</p>


<p>Large crowds of joyful Palestinians took to the streets in Gaza when the agreement was announced, cheering and honking car horns.</p>


<p>“No one can feel the feeling that we are experiencing now, an indescribable, indescribable feeling,” said Mahmoud Wadi in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah before joining a chanting crowd.</p>


<p>The Israel Hamas-war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. </p>


<p>Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when militants stormed into southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead.</p>


<p>Here's the latest:</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Netanyahu claims Hamas backtracked on an earlier understanding about prisoner release in the ceasefire deal</h3>


<p>JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Thursday that Hamas has backtracked on an earlier understanding of the ceasefire agreement. His statement could indicate that obstacles remain to implementing the deal. </p>


<p>Under the three-phased deal, Hamas would release dozens of hostages in exchange for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It would also allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes.</p>


<p>Netanyahu said that Hamas was objecting to a part of the agreement that gave Israel the ability to veto the release of certain Palestinian prisoners. Hamas was trying to dictate which Palestinian prisoners would be released, Netanyahu said.</p>


<p>He said he told Israeli negotiators to stand firm on the earlier agreement. Hamas did not immediately respond to Netanyahu’s statement.</p>


<p>The statement came soon after President Joe Biden wrapped up a final farewell address to the nation after earlier touting the role of American diplomacy in negotiating the ceasefire.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mediators will next head to Cairo for talks on implementing the ceasefire, US official says</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — Egyptian, Qatar and U.S. negotiators will head to Cairo on Thursday for further talks on implementing all aspects of the ceasefire deal, according to a senior U.S. official. </p>


<p>The official said the negotiators are focused on making sure expectations are clear to both Israel and Hamas, and that implementation of the agreement is carried out as smoothly as possible. </p>


<p>The official was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>By Aamer Madhani</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gaza’s second-largest militant group hails the ceasefire deal as ‘honorable’</h3>


<p>CAIRO — Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group after Hamas, hailed the cease-fire deal as “honorable.”</p>


<p>Hamas had needed the group's support for the deal in order to avoid a potential disruption in the process.</p>


<p>“Today, our people and their resistance imposed an honorable agreement to stop the aggression,” Palestinian Islamic Jihad said in a statement.</p>


<p>The group said the deal between Israel and Hamas includes the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as well as an “honorable” prisoner exchange. It said that militant groups in Gaza “will remain vigilant to ensure the full implementation of this agreement.”</p>


<p>Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s fighters took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and have since been battling Israeli forces in Gaza.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2 American hostages could be in first group freed from Gaza, US official says</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — A senior Biden administration official says two Americans, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, are expected to be released in the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire is set to begin Sunday and last for six weeks.</p>


<p>The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing efforts to get the hostages home.</p>


<p>There’s a least one other known living American captive in Gaza, an Israeli soldier named Edan Alexander, who will be released at a later date in the second phase of the agreement, the official said. It’s not clear how many of the hostages are still alive.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Netanyahu says the ceasefire is still not complete, hours after US announces deal</h3>


<p>JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the ceasefire agreement with Hamas is still not complete and final details are being worked out.</p>


<p>Netanyahu has not said explicitly whether he accepts the deal announced hours earlier by Qatar’s prime minister and President Joe Biden.</p>


<p>In a statement, Netanyahu said he would only issue a formal response “after the final details of the agreement, which are currently being worked on, are completed.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What does the ceasefire and hostage agreement say?</h3>


<p>Here are the basics of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal that mediators say has been reached. Any deal still needs the approval of Israel’s Cabinet. There are three phases.</p>


<p>Phase one starts Sunday, according to mediator Qatar. It should include a six-week halt to fighting and the opening of negotiations on ending the war. Thirty-three of the nearly 100 hostages should be released over the period, although it’s not clear if all are alive. They include women, older adults and wounded people. </p>


<p>Mediator the United States says this first phase also includes a withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza. That will allow many displaced Palestinians to return to their communities. Humanitarian assistance would surge, with hundreds of trucks entering Gaza each day. Final details still being worked out include the list of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners to be freed.</p>


<p>Phase two is harder. </p>


<p>Negotiations for this phase are to begin on Day 16 of the ceasefire. The phase would include the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers. Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. But Israel has said it will not agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated. And Hamas says it will not hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops.</p>


<p>Phase three calls for the return of the bodies of remaining hostages and the start of a major reconstruction of Gaza, which is largely devastated and faces decades of rebuilding.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gaza humanitarian situation, by the numbers:</h3>


<p>The ceasefire is meant to bring a surge in humanitarian aid to Gaza. Here’s what the United Nations has said of the situation inside the territory earlier this month:</p>


<p>- at least 1.9 million people are displaced</p>


<p>- 92% of housing units are destroyed</p>


<p>- 68% of the road network is destroyed or damaged</p>


<p>- there are “zero” fuel reserves to operate generators at hospitals</p>


<p>- 88% of school buildings need rebuilding or major repairs</p>


<p>- food aid amounting to three months’ of rations for Gaza’s population are waiting to enter</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">World leaders react to the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal</h3>


<p>NEW YORK — World leaders are calling the long-awaited ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas an opportunity for peace and stability in the Mideast.</p>


<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer celebrated the hostages who are set to return home and mourned the people killed in the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and in captivity. He promised to surge humanitarian aid to war-weary civilians in Gaza.</p>


<p>“Our attention must turn to how we secure a permanently better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people – grounded in a two-state solution that will guarantee security and stability for Israel, alongside a sovereign and viable Palestine state,” he said in a statement.</p>


<p>Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, a staunch ally of Israel, said all the remaining hostages and the bodies of those who died must be returned.</p>


<p>“This ceasefire opens the door to a permanent end to the war and to the improvement of the poor humanitarian situation in Gaza,” he said.</p>


<p>French President Emmanuel Macron wrote that, “The agreement must be respected. The hostages, freed. The Gazans, rescued. A political solution must be found.”</p>


<p>Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the deal, saying he hoped it would benefit “our region and all of humanity, and will open the door to lasting peace and stability.” He also paid respect to the Palestinians in Gaza who “courageously defended their land.”</p>


<p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the U.N. is ready to support implementation of the ceasefire deal and scale up delivery of humanitarian aid. “Our priority must be to ease the tremendous suffering caused by this conflict,” he said. </p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hamas calls ceasefire deal a result of Palestinians' ‘legendary resistance’</h3>


<p>CAIRO — The militant group Hamas is hailing its ceasefire with Israel as the result of “the legendary resilience of our great Palestinian people and our valiant resistance in the Gaza Strip.”</p>


<p>“The agreement is a milestone in the conflict with the enemy, on the path to achieving our people’s goals of liberation and return,” the statement said.</p>


<p>Khalil al-Hayyah, the acting head of Hamas’ political bureau and chief negotiator, said the ceasefire deal represents a “new phase” which will focus on Gaza rebuilding and recovering.</p>


<p>“We are able - with God’s help first - and then with the help of our brothers, siblings, loved ones and supporters, to rebuild Gaza again, alleviate the pain, heal the wounds,” he said in a speech shared online by Hamas.</p>


<p>He also congratulated the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners who will be released in the first phase of the deal: “Our heroic prisoners have an appointment with the dawn of freedom.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel fired at vehicles belonging to Syria's new military, killing 3, a war monitor says</h3>


<p>BEIRUT— The Israeli army said it fired at vehicles in Syria loaded with weapons near a buffer zone established under a 1974 agreement between Syria and Israel.</p>


<p>The strike in the town of Ghadir al-Bustan in Quneitra province killed three people, including two members of Syria's Military Operations Administration, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>


<p>The Military Operations Administration is run Syria’s de facto leadership under Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which did not comment on the attack. The attack coincided with Syrian security operations to search homes for weapons, according to the war monitor.</p>


<p>The Israeli military said located vehicles carrying weapons and “fired a warning shot adjacent to the vehicles, and the vehicles drove away from the area.” Asked about casualties, the Israeli military said it had no information.</p>


<p>Israeli forces captured the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights following former Syrian President Bashar Assad’s fall last month. The military has been also conducting incursions outside the buffer zone, prompting local protests.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Celebrations erupt in Lebanon over Gaza ceasefire</h3>


<p>BEIRUT — Celebrations erupted in several areas in Lebanon following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.</p>


<p>Many people flooded the streets in Palestinian refugee camps, as well as cities like Sidon in the south, Tripoli in the north and Beirut’s southern suburbs. People marched or rode motorcycles, honking in celebration while waving Hamas flags.</p>


<p>In some areas, nonstop shooting and fireworks rang out. Images circulated on social media showing several people wounded, with at least one killed, by stray bullets.</p>


<p>The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has strong ties to Hamas and had opened a support front on the day after Hamas’s attack Oct. 7, 2023, on Israel. This led to a 14-month war between Hezbollah and Israel, which ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire on Nov. 27. </p>


<p>Hezbollah has not commented on the Gaza ceasefire.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Palestinians march in the West Bank after ceasefire deal is announced</h3>


<p>RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinians are marching in part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and some have chanted, “Hamas!” in the hours after the Gaza ceasefire was announced Wednesday evening. </p>


<p>Associated Press video shows the men and women in the city of Ramallah, some holding flags. They also called out the name of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who masterminded the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war and was killed last year in Gaza. </p>


<p>The marchers also have chanted, “God is great.” They are stopping traffic in places, and security is nearby.</p>


<p>The West Bank, administered in part by the Palestinian Authority, has seen an increase in deadly unrest since the war in Gaza began.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bloodshed in Gaza had a profound effect on young people, US voter engagement group says</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — Voters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z voter engagement group in the U.S., said Wednesday's ceasefire deal is overdue and the war in Gaza had a profound effect on their generation.</p>


<p>"Gen Z, who has led the push for a ceasefire, will never forget the images of lifeless bodies and miles of rubble we’ve seen for over a year,” the organization said in a statement.</p>


<p>The group held Netanyahu responsible for his role in the military offensive and humanitarian crisis that has killed tens of thousands in Gaza, as well as Hamas for the “senseless violence on October 7th.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UN human rights chief demands accountability for both Israel and Hamas</h3>


<p>GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief says people responsible for killings of civilians and other rights violations committed in the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel and subsequent killings across Gaza over more than 15 months must be held to account.</p>


<p>Volker Türk also said human rights must be at the forefront of any reconstruction of Gaza after Wednesday’s announcement of a cease-fire between Israel and the militant group Hamas in the strip.</p>


<p>“The right of victims to full reparations must be upheld,” said Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a statement. “There is no true way forward without honest truth-telling and accountability on all sides.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The UN is working to rush aid into Gaza once the ceasefire begins</h3>


<p>UNITED NATIONS -- The top U.N. humanitarian official for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, has been discussing with senior Israeli and Palestinian officials how to increase desperately needed aid after a ceasefire takes effect.</p>


<p>The U.N. humanitarian office reported Tuesday that “Israeli authorities continue to deny U.N.-led efforts to reach people with vital assistance,” said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Tuesday.</p>


<p>He said U.N. efforts are “seriously constrained” by fighting, armed looting of aid convoys, Israeli access restrictions, road damage, unexplored ordnance, fuel shortages and a lack of telecommunications equipment.</p>


<p>Tom Fletcher, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said aid agencies have been mobilizing to scale up aid delivery across Gaza.</p>


<p>In a statement, Fletcher called for the protection of civilians and infrastructure, authorization for aid workers to have safe and “unfettered” access to people in need, and “removing all obstacles to the entry of essential aid.”</p>


<p>OCHA spokesperson Eri Kaneko, in an email, said, “we can only deliver as much as the conditions on the ground allow for us to do so.”</p>


<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington, emphasized that, “The surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin. And the innocent people can have a greater access to these vital supplies.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Palestinians express mixed reactions of relief and loss</h3>


<p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — A Palestinian man in central Gaza, Haitham Doghmosh, summed up the mixed reactions of relief and loss after the ceasefire was announced.</p>


<p>“Thank God that the agreement has been reached and that we will return to our homes, to our families, and to our loved ones,” he said, however, “It is true that our homes are gone, and our loved ones, our brothers, and our families are gone.”</p>


<p>In the city of Deir al-Balah, there were pounding drums, clapping and celebratory gunfire. Excited men hung out the windows of honking cars.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel’s president calls on Netanyahu government to approve the ceasefire</h3>


<p>JERUSALEM -- Israel’s president has called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to approve the Gaza ceasefire.</p>


<p>Isaac Herzog made the appeal in a nationally televised speech.</p>


<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Qatar’s prime minister announced the deal late Wednesday, but Netanyahu’s office did not immediately confirm its acceptance.</p>


<p>“I strengthen the hands of the prime minister and the negotiating team in their efforts to bring about a deal and call on the Israeli government to approve it when it is brought before them,” Herzog said.</p>


<p>Herzog’s position is largely ceremonial and is meant to serve as a unifying force and moral compass for the country.</p>


<p>Netanyahu’s Cabinet must approve the deal for it to go into effect. </p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israeli hostage families welcome ceasefire deal and thank mediators</h3>


<p>TEL AVIV, Israel -- The Hostage Families Forum, which represents many relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, has welcomed “with overwhelming joy and relief” the agreement between Israel and Hamas. </p>


<p>“We have been anxiously awaiting this moment, and now, after 460 days of our family members being held in Hamas tunnels, we are closer than ever to reuniting with our loved ones,” the group said in a statement shortly after the agreement was announced. </p>


<p>The group thanked both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations and the international mediators for facilitating the deal.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trump's pressure on Israel and Hamas to finish deal appears to have worked, analyst says</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has hammered home warnings that there better be a Gaza hostage deal by his Jan. 20 inauguration or “all hell would break out.”</p>


<p>Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both seem to have been listening.</p>


<p>Netanyahu’s agreement to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal Wednesday “ironically shows how effective actual pressure can be in changing Israeli government behavior,” said Nancy Okail, head of the U.S.-based Center for International Policy.</p>


<p>She accused Netanyahu of long stalling such a deal, and faulted Biden for not raising the stakes for Netanyahu in his continued objections to proposed terms.</p>


<p>Trump declared in a social media post last month “there will be ALL HELL TO PAY” if the hostages weren’t released before the U.S. Inauguration Day.</p>


<p>“It will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,” he told reporters this month, underscoring the deadline.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biden says Israel-Hamas ceasefire will hold if both sides keep negotiating for a lasting truce</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Joe Biden delivered a speech on the Israel-Hamas ceasefire immediately after fellow mediator Qatar announced a deal had been reached.</p>


<p>The six-week ceasefire will allow for negotiations to bring about a permanent end to the war, Biden said. He added if negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire would continue as long as talks continue. </p>


<p>Biden noted that his administration negotiated the deal but that Trump’s team will soon be charged with making sure it’s implemented. Trump’s incoming Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, had joined White House Middle East adviser Brett McGurk as the talks came to fruition in Doha.</p>


<p>“For the past few days, we have been speaking as one team,” Biden said.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First group of hostage</h3>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">s may be freed when ceasefire takes effect Sunday, US official says</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — Implementation of the agreement could begin Sunday, when the first group of hostages may be freed, according to a senior U.S. official involved in the talks. The official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>


<p>The U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators along with Israel’s team nearby worked until the wee hours Wednesday morning, just a floor above where the Hamas negotiators were also at work, the senior official said.</p>


<p>Later Thursday, Hamas made several last second demands, but “we held very firm” and Hamas eventually agreed to the terms of the deal, the U.S. official said.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biden hails Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden cheered the announcement of the ceasefire and hostage deal, and credited “dogged and painstaking American diplomacy” for landing the agreement, while claiming a measure of credit in the breakthrough moment in the 15-month war.</p>


<p>“I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council,” Biden added in a statement. “My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done.”</p>


<p>Biden’s comments came not long after President-elect Donald Trump in a social media post claimed his election victory is what brought about the deal.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Qatari prime minister formally announces ceasefire deal is reached between Israel and Hamas</h3>


<p>DOHA, Qatar -- Qatar’s prime minister on Wednesday announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, pausing the devastating 15-month war in Gaza and clearing the way for dozens of Israeli hostages to go home.</p>


<p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani announced the agreement in the Qatari capital of Doha, the site of weeks of painstaking negotiations. He said the deal would go into effect on Sunday. </p>


<p>Officials had earlier said a deal had been reached. There was still no confirmation from Israel.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Families of American hostages in Gaza are grateful a deal is reached</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON -- The families of the seven American hostages still held in Gaza expressed their deep gratitude for news that Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire and hostage deal Wednesday.</p>


<p>“The coming days and weeks will be just as painful for our families as the entirety of our loved ones’ horrific ordeals,” the families’ statement said. “That is why we ask all parties to stay committed to this agreement, every phase until it is fully implemented and everyone has been returned.”</p>


<p>Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, although it’s unclear if all are alive.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Turkey says the drawn-out Gaza ceasefire talks prolonged civilian suffering</h3>


<p>ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s foreign minister said a year of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza needlessly prolonged civilian suffering and “only provided more time for Israel’s operations.”</p>


<p>Hakan Fidan spoke at a news conference Wednesday in Ankara shortly before officials confirmed a deal had been reached.</p>


<p>“What happened? Fifty thousand people, mostly women and children, were massacred, human dignity was trampled and the international system emerged as dead and buried,” he said.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel's Netanyahu says a ceasefire deal with Hamas is still not reached</h3>


<p>JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says a ceasefire deal with Hamas has still not been reached.</p>


<p>In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said that final details were still unresolved, but that it hoped “details will be finalized tonight.”</p>


<p>That comes after multiple officials had said Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza and the release dozens of hostages after more than 15 months of war.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israeli airstrike in the West Bank kills 6 people, medics say</h3>


<p>RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike in the occupied West Bank has killed six men.</p>


<p>It said the strike occurred Wednesday in Jenin, an epicenter of Israeli-Palestinian violence in recent years. Israeli military acknowledged the strike but did not comment further.</p>


<p>An Israeli drone strike in Jenin on Tuesday also killed six people. </p>


<p>The Israeli military has carried out frequent raids into Jenin targeting militants, often igniting gunbattles. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority has also been carrying out a rare crackdown on militants in Jenin in recent weeks.</p>


<p>The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trump cheers for the hostage release and ceasefire deal</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump celebrated the soon-to-be-announced ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas in a post on his Truth Social social media platform. </p>


<p>“WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!” Trump wrote.</p>


<p>Trump's incoming Mideast envoy had joined Biden’s Mideast adviser for the talks in Doha.</p>


<p>Trump also claimed credit for the agreement being reached.</p>


<p>“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” Trump wrote on social media. “I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.”</p>


<p>Trump last week had vowed “all hell” would break loose on Hamas if a deal wasn’t reached before his inauguration next week.</p>


<p>Trump in his posting added that his incoming Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, would continue “to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.”</p>


<p>His incoming national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz, in his own posting on X also credited Trump calling the development, “The Trump Effect.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Palestinians and Israelis react to ceasefire deal</h3>


<p>KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — In the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, large crowds of joyful Palestinians have taken to the streets, with people cheering and honking car horns.</p>


<p>“We have been waiting for this happiness for a year and a half. No one can feel the feeling that we are experiencing now, an indescribable, indescribable feeling,” said Mahmoud Wadi in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah before joining a chanting crowd. </p>


<p>Even as Palestinians celebrated outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, an ambulance with its sirens and flashing lights hurriedly wove among the crowd.</p>


<p>Ashraf Sahwiel, a displaced man who is currently living in a tent in Deir al-Balah with five family members, said all 2 million people in Gaza have been closely following the negotiations in recent days — even children, who are eager to return to their homes.</p>


<p>As news of the deal reached Israel, “hostages square” in Tel Aviv was calm, with some people unaware that it had gone through.</p>


<p>Sharone lifschitz, whose father Oded is being held hostage told the AP by phone she was stunned and grateful but won’t believe it until she sees them come home.</p>


<p>“I can’t wait to see them coming back to their families I’m so desperate to see them if by some miracle my father has survived,” she said.</p>


<p>Now it’s up to everyone not to sabotage it, she said.</p>


<p>Some people whose friends are being held hostage said they won’t trust the deal until all the hostages returned.</p>


<p>“I don’t trust Hamas, don’t trust them at all to bring them back,” said Vered Froner. She and her mother hid in a safe room for 17 hours in Nachal Oz kibbutz during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.</p>


<p>She said she’d prefer to have had all of the hostages return at once rather than a phased approach.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">US officials confirm a ceasefire deal is reached between Israel and Hamas</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — A deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas that will see some hostages freed and the pause war in Gaza, three US officials confirmed to The Associated Press. </p>


<p>One official said that it was expected that the ceasefire would be implemented in the coming days. All three requested anonymity to discuss the contours of the deal before the official announcement by mediators in Doha.</p>


<p>President Joe Biden was preparing to address the breakthrough agreement later Thursday, officials said.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel and Hamas agree to ceasefire deal to pause Gaza war and release some hostages, mediators say</h3>


<p>DOHA, Qatar — Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal, mediators announced Wednesday, pausing a devastating 15-month war in the Gaza Strip and raising the possibility of winding down the the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies.</p>


<p>The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a devastated territory.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Palestinians await news of a ceasefire</h3>


<p>DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Dozens of displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip lined up at a charity kitchen on Wednesday as they awaited word of a ceasefire.</p>


<p>Aman Abu Jarad, a displaced woman from Beit Hanoun, is yearning to return home and rejoin her siblings and loved ones, despite the massive destruction across the Gaza Strip.</p>


<p>“Even though it has already been bombed, at least we return to our land. The moment a ceasefire takes hold, there is a psychological relief, and you return to the land you used to live on better than being in humiliation,” she said.</p>


<p>Nearly 2 million Palestinians in the territory have been displaced because of the war and are suffering from malnutrition, lack of food aid, destroyed healthcare infrastructure and harsh winter conditions.</p>


<p>“We would ululate as we go back home safely, but our homes have been bombed and everything is gone. Where do we go?” said Kifaiya Al-Attar, a displaced woman from Beit Lahiya.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A last-minute snag in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks is resolved, Hamas official says</h3>


<p>DOHA, Qatar -- A Hamas official says a last-minute dispute in ceasefire talks between the militant group and Israel has been resolved.</p>


<p>Israel announced late Wednesday that Hamas had tried to change agreed-upon understandings for security arrangements along Gaza’s border with Egypt. It strongly rejected the proposals.</p>


<p>The Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, confirmed the matter was resolved.</p>


<p>There was still no official word on whether a final agreement had been reached.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">White House team thinks Gaza ceasefire still has issues that need to be ironed out, officials say</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — White House Middle East adviser Brett McGurk had briefed Biden administration officials on the status of the negotiations early Wednesday and told them that talks were continuing but there were still issues that needed to be ironed out, according to two administration officials familiar with the matter who were not authorized to comment publicly.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel says it confiscated 3,300 weapons from Syrian territory</h3>


<p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said it had confiscated over 3,300 weapons in the past six weeks in and around areas in Syria where Israeli troops have operated close to the Golan Heights.</p>


<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said troops will occupy a buffer zone inside Syria for the foreseeable future. Israel said it has seized Syrian army tanks, weapons, anti-tank missiles, rocket propelled grenades, shells, mortars and mortar shells, and observation equipment, among other weapons.</p>


<p>Israel’s capture of the buffer zone in December following the ouster of President Bashar Assad has sparked criticism that Israel was violating a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria. Syrians in the areas Israeli forces have moved into have protested their presence and complained about the lack of action by the country’s new authorities to pressure Israel to withdraw.</p>


<p>The military said the seizure of weapons and its presence in the buffer zone are necessary to ensure the security of Israel and the Golan Heights.</p>


<p>Israel seized control of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it — a move not recognized by most of the international community.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Norway says a ceasefire for Gaza is only the beginning of a long recovery</h3>


<p>OSLO, Norway — Norway’s foreign minister says it’s important to look ahead to the longer-term future as hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rise.</p>


<p>Espen Barth Eide said at an event in Oslo Wednesday attended by Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa that “that it’s really the moment to deep dive into what will then happen next.”</p>


<p>He cautioned that “just the ceasefire can easily create the sense of vacuum, of unfulfilled hope. And the problems in Gaza would not be over. The divisions will not be over. The hatred would not be laid to rest if it was only a ceasefire.”</p>


<p>Barth Eide said the international community expects “that Israel understands that it’s time to move on and to help solve the long outstanding issue of Palestine. And of course, that our friends in Palestine also work effectively together to build a strong government and a strong capacity that all the Palestinian territories are united, so that both sides have a good partner in building peace.”</p>


<p>Norway is one of three European countries that formally recognized a Palestinian state in May.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Palestinian prime minister says Palestinian Authority should run Gaza in future</h3>





<p>OSLO, Norway — The Palestinian prime minister says it’s unacceptable for any entity other than the Palestinian Authority to run the Gaza Strip in the future, as Israel and Hamas appear to be at the closest point yet to sealing a deal to end 15 months of war.</p>


<p>“While we’re waiting for the ceasefire, it’s important to stress that it will not be acceptable for any entity to govern Gaza Strip but the legitimate Palestinian leadership and the government of the State of Palestine,” Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said Wednesday. He was visiting Norway, one of three European countries that formally recognized a Palestinian state in May.</p>


<p>Mustafa said “any attempt to consolidate the separation between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, or creating transitional entities, will be rejected.” </p>


<p>Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, confining the Western-backed Palestinian Authority’s limited self-rule to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The U.S. has called for a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern both the West Bank and Gaza ahead of eventual statehood, which the Israeli government opposes.</p>
