<p>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) - The students are accused of combing through websites like Pornhub in attempts to find videos or pictures of women or girls who resembled their high school female classmates.</p>



<p>At least one of the boys would match up skin tone, hair styles, body types and other features, according to newly released court documents, and then he would superimpose the names of his juvenile female classmates onto the videos and photos.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>Afterward, the boys would share or sell the videos and photos to others within the student body as well as to students at other high schools, advertising them as actually depicting their female classmates - violating Indiana Code banning the making or distributing of child pornography in the process.</p>



<p>A lawsuit filed Tuesday in Marion County claims this happened at Bishop Luers High School as early as 2022 and in 2023.</p>



<p>The lawsuit also claims that Bishop Luers officials not only knew all about the scheme -- supposedly perpetrated by at least three boys and involving dozens of girls -- but failed to report it to authorities while also trying to stonewall giving any updates of a supposed investigation to the girls' parents.</p>



<p>The lawsuit - filed by four sets of parents to girls who never gave their consent to have their names in the videos - paints a picture of a scandal that was widely known among students and leadership alike but somehow remained within the Luers bubble while school officials did everything they could to not deal with the situation.</p>



<p>"(The Defendants) engaged in a plan and scheme to ignore, conceal and/or avoid discovery of these videos, and the defendants' wrongful conduct facilitated the on-going exploitation and abuse of minor children at Bishop Luers," the lawsuit said. </p>



<p>School officials are accused of being negligent, failing to follow its own protocols in reporting child abuse and criminal activity while also failing to protect the girls, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>It further claims that as news of the videos spread higher up the chain to diocese and archdiocese officials, nobody - from the boys involved in the scheme to the school officials accused of failing to do their duty - suffered any punishment or discipline. </p>



<p>The Archdiocese of Indianapolis as well as the Diocese of South Bend-Fort Wayne and Bishop Luers itself are named as defendants in the lawsuit. The school's former principal, the school's current principal, its athletic director and an official with the local diocese are also named in the lawsuit.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>When reached for comment, Bishop Luers officials referred all questions to officials with the local diocese. Officials with the local diocese had not returned emails to WANE as of Wednesday morning. </p>



<p>When reached for comment, an official with the archdiocese said no lawsuit had been served to officials there.</p>



<p>"It would be surprising that a lawsuit involving Bishop Luers would be filed against the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, as Bishop Luers High School is located in the Diocese of Ft. Wayne-South Bend," the official said to WANE 15 in an email.</p>



<p>According to the suit, the archdiocese is listed because it "created, oversaw, managed, controlled and or directed all employees assigned to work in the dioceses and schools of the archdiocese, including the Fort Wayne South Bend Diocese." </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Parties Involved</h3>



<p>The identities of the girls and their parents are not revealed in the lawsuit. </p>



<p>The boys accused of making and or distributing the photos and videos are only identified in the lawsuit with initials, though at least one is identified as a member of the football team. The suit also claims that one of the boys was "convicted in Allen County juvenile court for one or more crimes related to the videos" while the other two boys were not prosecuted.   </p>



<p>Juvenile criminal records are not public in Allen County. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
</div>


<p>According to the suit, Bishop Luers Principal Scott Kreiger and the Dean of Students Kevin Mann - who is also the school's athletic director - were aware about the videos as early as February 2023.</p>



<p>The suit also claims former principal James Huth, who stepped down from his role in 2023 and took on a director of development role, knew about the videos. </p>



<p>Despite knowing about the videos, the suit claims that Huth, Kreiger and Mann did not alert the Bishop Luers School Board, police nor the girls' parents about the videos.</p>



<p>At no time did Luers officials seize the cell phones or other personal electronic devices of the boys who are accused of being involved in the scheme, according to the lawsuit. Luers officials also held no formal meetings with officials of the diocese or the archdiocese, and they also failed to remove the boys from school or discipline them in any way, the suit claims.</p>



<p>The parents of the girls who filed the suit did not become aware of the videos until the middle of September 2023, when one of the boys showed one of the videos on his phone to one of the girls during school. </p>



<p>That prompted the parents to raise the alarm about the videos, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">'Destroy Your Reputation'</h3>



<p>It's not entirely clear how the parents who filed the suit pegged February 2023 as the time when Bishop Luers officials became aware of the videos. </p>



<p>One of the girls, however, became aware of the videos when one of the boys accused of being involved in the scheme approached her at school on Sept. 19, 2023. </p>



<p>"I know something that's really bad, something that will destroy your reputation," the boy said to the girl, according to the suit.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>The boy eventually showed her a pornographic video on his phone that had her name, and he told her another boy had made the video, according to the lawsuit. He added that the boy who made the video had been "selling it and was representing to potential 'customers' that the video or videos depicted Bishop Luers students," the lawsuit said.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, this is when Luers officials began avoiding discussions or confrontations with the girls or their parents. </p>



<p>The following day, at least two of the girls depicted in the videos went directly to Mann to speak about the videos, according to the lawsuit. They also offered to show him the video, the suit said. Mann, however, is accused of declining to watch it as "he admitted he was already aware of it," according to the suit.  </p>



<p>A father of one of the girls that day went to speak with Mann and approached him as he was leaving the school. According to the lawsuit, Mann initially refused to speak to the father, "claiming that he needed to get to a soccer game," according to the lawsuit. </p>



<p>After the father persisted, Mann told him he was still investigating, the lawsuit said.</p>



<p>The father said he tried to call Mann the next day, but Mann would not take his call and would not return a voicemail, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>That night, one of the boys involved in the scheme was supposed to dress for the varsity football game. According to the lawsuit, Bishop Luers Head Coach Kyle Lindsay wanted to keep him from dressing for the game.</p>



<p>Kreiger and Mann, however, overruled him, according to the lawsuit, and the boy was allowed to play.</p>



<p>The two other boys accused of being involved were also allowed to continue playing their respective sports after the discovery of the videos, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">'We Don't Want to Falsely Accuse the Boys'</h3>



<p>Fort Wayne police did not get involved with the videos until Sept. 25, 2023, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>And it took an ultimatum from the parents for it to happen. </p>



<p>Parents of some of the girls had a lengthy meeting between Kreiger and Mann that day, the lawsuit said.</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, Mann admitted to the parents that the school had been "dealing with" the pornographic videos for "some time." He also admitted the videos had not been reported to the authorities, the suit said.</p>



<p>"During this confrontation at the school on September 25, defendant Kreiger repeatedly proclaimed: 'We don't want to falsely accuse the boys!'" the lawsuit reads. </p>



<p>Mann and Kreiger are accused of meeting privately for at least three hours while the parents waited at the school afterward. According to the suit, Mann and Kreiger conferred with counsel while trying to figure out how to proceed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
</div>


<p>Mann also questioned one of the boys, according to the lawsuit, who apparently admitted to making the videos. </p>



<p>Still, Mann refused to call police, the lawsuit said.</p>



<p>"That same day, Mann asserted to the plaintiffs that, in his opinion, no crime had been committed and therefore Bishop Luers had no duty to contact the authorities about the videos," the lawsuit said.</p>



<p>"Only after the plaintiffs gave him an ultimatum that they would call the police themselves if the school refused did Mann finally agree to 'call a buddy and find out what to do,'" the lawsuit continued.   </p>



<p>During the wait for a police officer to show up, Kreiger supposedly conceded to the parents that counsel with the diocese agreed the police should be contacted, the suit said.</p>



<p>“This case demonstrates what happens when those entrusted with our children’s care don’t uphold their legal and moral responsibility to protect them,” said attorney Greg Laker of CohenMalad, which filed the lawsuit. “Instead, Bishop Luers High School, the Diocese and Archdiocese prioritized their own public image and reputation, utterly failing the student-victims.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Questioning Without Parents</h3>



<p>Further accusations against school officials detail how they dealt with the girls whose names appeared in the videos. </p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the parents told both Kreiger and Mann during the Sept. 25 meeting they did not have permission to question or interrogate their daughters without the parents being present. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleges the complete opposite occurred in the days afterward. </p>



<p>"Despite the clear instruction from the parents, Mann, Kreiger and other representatives of Bishop Luers and the Diocese harassed, intimidated and publicly worsened the crisis by publicly paging (the girls) and other victims during school hours to report to school offices, and by pulling them out of their classrooms to discuss the matter on multiple occasions," the lawsuit claims. </p>



<p>One of the girls was pulled out of class in the middle of a writing assignment she was unable to make up, according to court documents. </p>



<p>During these meetings with the girls, the lawsuit claims that Kreiger told them he "he needed others" to investigate before he could do anything about the videos and that he needed authority from people "higher than him" to give him the ability to decide what to do with the boys involved.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
</div>


<p>The suit also claims he told the girls school administrators "have a lot of things on our plates right now" and that "women's brains and boys' brains are very different" and that "guys will do guy things." </p>



<p>When the girls explained during one of these meetings they were terrified about the videos showing up online - especially during search results of their names - Mann is accused of dismissing their concerns, the lawsuit said. </p>



<p>He told them they "shouldn't care what others think," according to the lawsuit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Calls Go Higher</h3>



<p>Some of the parents who filed the lawsuit soon began to make calls to the Diocese of South Bend-Fort Wayne, which oversees Bishop Luers, to ask if any of the Bishop Luers officials would be suspended or disciplined, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>David Maugel, who at the time the videos were made was assistant superintendent of the diocese, told the parents the situation was "not a disciplinary issue, merely a training issue," the lawsuit claims. </p>



<p>Maugel, who is now the acting superintendent of the diocese, also told one of the parents he was "handling the situation" but offered no explanation why no one had reported the videos to authorities, according to allegations in the lawsuit. </p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, the diocese's victim advocate told parents that one of the videos was shared with the Bishop in early September 2023.</p>



<p>In October, Maugel is accused of telling one of the parents the "case was closed" and that the only consequence to Kreiger and Mann would be to instruct them how to report such a situation in the future, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>He also said the parent should "give grace and learn trust," the lawsuit claims. </p>



<p>In the fall, another diocese official told one of the parents Mann had been removed from his leadership role, though the lawsuit contends his salary has not changed and he continues to be in a decision-making role at Bishop Luers.</p>



<p>In October 2023, a local detective investigating the videos told the parents the contents of the videos indeed constituted a crime, according to the lawsuit. </p>



<p>In total, it is believed that 38 current and former Bishop Luers students were victimized in the scheme, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>The suit comes on the heels of former Bishop Luers teachers Jordan Miller and Matthew Brown being sentenced for sex crimes against minors in the last few years.</p>



<p>Miller had been accused of having sex with multiple students during the school year in 2018. The allegations against him came to light in 2023 and he ultimately pleaded guilty to two counts of child seduction. A judge sentenced him to serve four years in prison. </p>



<p>One of the students he had sex with filed a lawsuit against the school, the local diocese and Miller last year. That lawsuit is still winding its way through the legal system. </p>



<p>“The sexual exploitation these minors have suffered is profoundly dehumanizing,” said attorney Andrea Simmons of CohenMalad. “To have victims further harmed by leadership’s deliberate concealment of the crimes reflects a shocking indifference for the dignity and well-being of students.”</p>
