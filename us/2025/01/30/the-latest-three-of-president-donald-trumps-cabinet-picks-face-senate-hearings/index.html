    <p>Three of President Donald Trump’s cabinet picks prepared to face skepticism and intense grilling from Democratic senators during their confirmation hearings Thursday.</p><p>What we’re following:</p><p><ul> <p>  1. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s second hearing: Kennedy will have the second of two confirmation hearings for his Health and Human Services Secretary nomination. He     will appear before the Health Committee    a day after     his hearing before the Finance Committee    . </p> <p>  2. Tulsi Gabbard for DNI Secretary: Gabbard, Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, is expected to face tough questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee over     past comments about Russia    and a 2017 visit with     Syria’s now-deposed leader    . </p> <p>  3. Kash Patel’s hearing:     Patel    , Trump’s pick to lead the FBI,     will likely encounter deeply skeptical questioning    from Democratic senators Thursday about his loyalty to the president and stated desire to overhaul the bureau. </p></ul></p><p>Here's the latest:</p><p>Democratic senator questions RFK on social media post about 9/11</p><p>Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, asked why Kennedy said that he would “not take sides” as conspiracy theorists question what happened during the attacks.</p><p>Kennedy responded that he had been taught from a young age to question authority.</p><p>“My father told me when I was 13 years old, he said, ‘People in authority lie,’” Kennedy said.</p><p>GOP holdout grills Gabbard on her prior support of Snowden</p><p>Republican Sen. Susan Collins is one of the few Republicans who have not yet supported the nominee. She asked if Gabbard would support or recommend clemency to Snowden if she were confirmed as director of national intelligence.</p><p>Gabbard, who earlier said that Snowden exposed “egregious illegal and unconstitutional programs,” said she would not take actions to advocate for anything regarding Snowden.</p><p>Gabbard dodges answering whether she still thinks leaker Edward Snowden was ‘brave’</p><p>Gabbard repeatedly refused to answer the question from Warner, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee.</p><p>He pressed her on the point, noting that she sponsored legislation while in Congress to end prosecution of Snowden for leaking classified security information.</p><p>Gabbard answered that “Snowden broke the law” and that she didn’t support “all” of his release of information. That said, she added, Snowden exposed “egregious illegal and unconstitutional programs.”</p><p>Gabbard says she’s nobody’s ‘puppet’</p><p>Gabbard issued a stark warning to the American public, trying to get ahead of aggressive questioning on her past comments and actions related to Russia and Syria.</p><p>“You may hear lies and smears in this hearing that will challenge my loyalty to and my love for our country,” Gabbard said. “Those who oppose my nomination imply that I am loyal to something or someone other than God, my own conscience and the Constitution of the United States.”</p><p>She said critics are “accusing me of being Trump’s puppet, Putin’s puppet, Assad’s puppet, a guru’s puppet, Modi’s puppet, not recognizing the absurdity of simultaneously being the puppet of five different puppet masters.”</p><p>What “truly unsettles” political opponents is her refusal to be “their puppet.”</p><p>Gabbard has scathing comments about US intelligence community</p><p>“Faulty, inadequate, or weaponized intelligence have led to costly failures and the undermining of our national security,” Gabbard told senators.</p><p>She cited the intelligence that led to the invasion of Iraq, and what she said was the intelligence community’s mishandling of intelligence on Hunter Biden.</p><p>“The bottom line is this must end.”</p><p>She called Trump’s election “a clear mandate from the American people to break this cycle of failure and the weaponization and politicization of the intelligence community and begin to restore trust in those who’ve been charged with the critical task of securing our nation.”</p><p>Homeland Security freezes funding for immigration-related nonprofits</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security is pausing federal money for nonprofits providing immigration services.</p><p>Secretary Kristi Noem’s memo says she’s concerned the grants may be “encouraging or inducing illegal immigration.” Grants that “touch in any way on immigration” are now on hold, effective immediately, pending a review.</p><p>Many such grants help communities near the U.S.-Mexico border that are dealing with recent arrivals. Advocates say they provide vital services; critics say they essentially facilitate illegal immigration.</p><p>Cities including New York, Denver and Chicago also receive grant funding to help deal with immigration influxes.</p><p>The order — signed Tuesday — didn’t say whether their funding was affected.</p><p>Kennedy also refuses to reject discredited theory that vaccines cause autism</p><p>Cassidy pressed Kennedy to “unequivocally” say that measles and hepatitis B vaccines do not cause autism.</p><p>Kennedy refused, calling for more research on the issue, despite the theory being long discredited.</p><p>“The data has been there for a long time,” Cassidy said.</p><p>Kennedy won’t agree that COVID-19 vaccines save lives</p><p>Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders asked Kennedy if he agrees that COVID-19 vaccines are lifesaving.</p><p>Kennedy refused to be pinned down, saying there’s no good surveillance system.</p><p>In fact U.S. and international researchers have clearly shown the safety and benefit of those vaccines. When vaccines are cleared for use in the U.S., they’re continued to be tracked through multiple monitoring systems including electronic medical records from health care systems.</p><p>“You’re applying for the job -- clearly you should know this. And the scientific community has established that COVID vaccines saved millions of lives and you’re casting doubt,” Sanders said.</p><p>GOP allies blast media coverage of Gabbard’s nomination</p><p>Former Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina introduced Gabbard, outlining what he called a “coordinated effort” to “kill” her nomination to lead America’s national intelligence agencies.</p><p>“I experienced firsthand coordination to influence her nomination before the United States Senate and with the American people,” Burr said, without providing any details.</p><p>GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, a fellow female veteran, echoed that sentiment. She said “mainstream media” has not painted “the full picture” of Gabbard.</p><p>Republican senator calls out Kennedy’s anti-vaccine claims</p><p>Cassidy said data showing both the measles and hepatitis B vaccines were safe and not associated with autism has been clear for more than 16 years — and asked why Kennedy hasn’t taken the time to look at data that refutes his anti-vaccine claims.</p><p>Kennedy said if he’s shown the data he will recommend the vaccines — and “not only will I do that but I will apologize for any statements that misled people otherwise.”</p><p>Patel questioned about Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons</p><p>“There can never be a tolerance for violence against law enforcement and anyone, anyone that commits an act of violence against law enforcement must be investigated, prosecuted and imprisoned,” Patel said.</p><p>He has been an outspoken critic of how the Justice Department has prosecuted and detained rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 and brutalized police.</p><p>Durbin pressed him on whether he supports Trump’s sweeping pardons of rioters who committed violence on Jan. 6.</p><p>Patel’s response: “I do not agree with the commutation of any sentence of any individual who committed violence against law enforcement.”</p><p>Democrat condemns Gabbard’s support for leaker Edward Snowden</p><p>Warner said Gabbard had “celebrated” former contractor’s Edward Snowden’s leaks of classified U.S. intelligence — leaks that he said put American forces at risk.</p><p>Warner noted Gabbard had pushed legislation seeking a pardon for Snowden, who has since become a Russian citizen.</p><p>“You think that someone who did bold secrets and then ran off to Russia should be celebrated as brave,” Warner said.</p><p>Patel says he would remain focused on FBI’s core mission</p><p>He said that’s to “investigate fully wherever there is a constitutional factual basis to do so.”</p><p>“Protecting the rights of the Constitution is of the utmost importance to me, and has been every single time I’ve taken that oath of office,” he said in his opening statement.</p><p>His comments are unlikely to ease Democrats’ concerns that he might use the agency to go after Trump’s political adversaries. Patel has repeatedly stated a desire to rid the government of “conspirators” and has suggested that a Trump victory could result in investigations of lawmakers who have committed “federal felonies” and “covered up the truth from the American people.”</p><p>Gabbard opposed a government surveillance program — and now supports it</p><p>One of the biggest policy disputes in Gabbard’s confirmation hearing is her longstanding opposition to a government surveillance program called FISA Section 702. The law permits the U.S. government to compel electronic communications providers such as Google and Microsoft to turn over communications on their servers with foreign intelligence value.</p><p>It’s a powerful authority that turns U.S. technology providers into the eyes and ears of U.S. intelligence. It’s been controversial on Capitol Hill because while it does not permit the U.S. government to target Americans, sometimes their communications are swept up when they communicate with foreigners.</p><p>The U.S. government has taken the position that it is permitted to search its database for information on Americans in limited instances. Gabbard has previously proposed repealing the law but has since said she changed her mind and supports the authority.</p><p>Cassidy to Kennedy — Can I trust you?</p><p>Cassidy was blunt — he’s not sure if Kennedy’s claim that he’s not anti-vaccine is real.</p><p>“I’ve seen the benefits of vaccines. I know they save lives. I know they’re a crucial part of keeping our country healthy,” Cassidy said.</p><p>But Cassidy said his constituents have told him they “partly credit you for their decision to not vaccinate their child.”</p><p>Cassidy asked if Kennedy would tell mothers to question doctors about vaccines. For many, he said, that “would be permission to not vaccinate their children.”</p><p>“Your past undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me. Can I trust that that is now in the past?” he asked.</p><p>Health committee chairman shares how vaccines could have saved his patient</p><p>Under questioning on Army training accidents from New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Secretary of the Army nominee Daniel Driscoll said that from what he’s seen, Wednesday night’s collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet over the Potomac River was “an accident that seems to be preventable.”</p><p>Driscoll said there are appropriate times to take risks and there are inappropriate ones.</p><p>He told senators he would work with the Senate Armed Services Committee to examine operations.</p><p>“I think we might need to look at where is an appropriate time to take a training risk, and it may not be near an airport like Reagan.”</p><p>Top Democrat on Intel panel raises ‘significant concerns’ about Gabbard</p><p>Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said that despite several meetings with Gabbard, he remains concerned about her past actions and comments and how that could jeopardize America’s standing on the world stage.</p><p>Warner said these concerns “lead me to question whether you can develop the trust necessary between us and our allies.”</p><p>“If they stop sharing that intelligence with the United States, we are less safe,” Warner said.</p><p>GOP chair defends Gabbard’s background, ‘unconventional views’</p><p>Cotton is defending Trump’s nominee to lead the nation’s intelligence agencies, saying Gabbard has served the U.S. and passed all the necessary background checks for this role.</p><p>“Some of my Democratic colleagues may criticize Ms. Gabbard’s statements and actions since she saw the light and left the Democratic Party,” Cotton said. “But I sincerely hope that no one will question Ms. Gabbard’s patriotism and integrity.”</p><p>Cotton said he can only laugh at some critics who say that Ms. Gabbard has unconventional views.</p><p>Tom Cotton wants change at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence</p><p>Cotton’s opening statement at Gabbard’s hearing takes aim at the position and structure of the office that was born out of 9/11 intelligence failures to coordinate among the many agencies that make up the U.S intelligence community.</p><p>The job of Director of National Intelligence has sometimes been criticized for having lots of responsibility without a lot of power. The job involves trying to coordinate between 18 different agencies that are nestled under a half dozen different cabinet agencies, which all have their own interests and leadership and priorities.</p><p>Cotton is vowing to try to reform the office and send some of its personnel back to their home agencies.</p><p>GOP committee chair closely questions RFK on vaccines</p><p>Kennedy is getting tough questions on how he would lead the country’s vaccination programs from a crucial Republican senator.</p><p>Cassidy leaned his previous experience as a physician and how he led vaccination campaigns that he called life-saving.</p><p>“What will you tell the American mother, will you tell her to vaccinate her child or not?” asked Cassidy, whose vote could determine whether Kennedy’s nomination survives.</p><p>Patel’s own words are being used against him</p><p>Durbin’s opening statement shows how Democrats hope to use Patel’s litany of provocative statements against him.</p><p>Patel has appeared on dozens of podcasts over the years and published a book called “Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth and the Battle for Our Democracy,” leaving behind an extensive record of his controversial views.</p><p>“He traffics in debunked conspiracy theories that serve or benefit his political beliefs,” Durbin said.</p><p>Durbin highlighted Patel’s comments about the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol. Patel suggested that the FBI was “planning January 6 for a year” and helped produce a song called “Justice for All,” that was recorded over a prison phone line, sung by a group of Jan. 6 defendants.</p><p>Sen. Dick Durbin w</p><p>arns Patel against politicizing the FBI</p><p>Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, began his remarks by warning about the FBI’s past surveillance of civil rights leaders and political opponents during the tenure of J. Edgar Hoover. He noted that the Senate had passed reforms in 1976 “intended to insulate the position from political influence.”</p><p>“During the time I served on this committee, I’ve had the opportunity to consider four FBI director nominations. Each one was a Republican, and I voted for all,” said Durbin. His dismissed claims that former President Joe Biden had “weaponized” the FBI for political ends as Patel has previously argued.</p><p>John McCain’s daughter comes to support Gabbard’s confirmation</p><p>chatting with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona in the Senate hearing room ahead of Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation hearing for Director of National Intelligence.</p><p>McCain has been a vocal supporter of Gabbard since she was nominated by Trump to be a member of his Cabinet.</p><p>Army Secretary nominee Daniel Driscoll is questioned at a delicate moment</p><p>Secretary of the Army nominee Daniel Driscoll opened his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Armed Services only hours after the crash of an Army helicopter into a passenger flight over the Potomac River.</p><p>Driscoll spoke about the many victims who died in the crash and guaranteed that he’ll be committed to make sure nothing like it ever happens again.</p><p>▶ Read more on developments in the plane crash</p><p>Kennedy’s second confirmation hearing begins</p><p>Kennedy is now appearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, known as HELP.</p><p>It’s a crucial day for both Kennedy and the committee chairman, Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who could be an all-important swing vote for confirmation.</p><p>Cassidy, a doctor himself, closely questioned Kennedy yesterday before the Senate’s Finance Committee, while his Republican colleagues gave the nominee a warmer reception.</p><p>It’s close quarters today, with senators, aides, reporters and Kennedy’s supporters packed into the 5th floor hearing room of a Senate office building.</p><p>Grassley decries ‘false smears’ as he opens Patel confirmation hearing</p><p>Chairman Grassley says Patel has faced “unfounded attacks” and “false smears.” But Grassley said Patel has “precisely the qualifications we need at this time when the FBI is not being respected by our public.”</p><p>Grassley is touting Patel’s background managing large intelligence and defense bureaucracies while fighting for government transparency.</p><p>“Public trust in the FBI is low,” Grassley said, repeating Republican claims that the agency has been used in recent years as a political weapon. “It’s your job to restore the public trust and return the FBI to its core mission of fighting crime.”</p><p>A large group in the room are wearing shirts from Moms Demand Action, a liberal gun safety group. Others are wearing pro-Second Amendment clothing.</p><p>Close Trump aides join Patel at hearing</p><p>They include Sebastian Gorka, Ric Grennell and former Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who are present in the hearing room with him.</p><p>The confirmation hearing is getting underway for Kash Patel</p><p>President Donald Trump’s pick to become FBI director is expected to face tough questioning from Democrats about his loyalty to the Republican president and his staunch criticism over the years over the agency he’s been tapped to lead.</p><p>FBI wrestles </p><p>with a spike in sexual misconduct claims and male-dominated culture</p><p>ranging from assault to harassment. Bureau leaders pledged to eliminate the longstanding problem, but an Associated Press investigation found nearly 300 sexual misconduct allegations involving agents and staff since its 2021 launch of an agency-wide crackdown.</p><p>The FBI says the numbers show reforms are working to make reporting misconduct easier. Critics say the bureau is struggling to protect women in a male-dominated workplace.</p><p>“Enough is enough,” Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, told the AP in a statement. The Senate Judiciary chairman vowed “to get answers and root out further FBI misconduct.”</p><p>Patel’s spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment ahead of his confirmation hearing.</p><p>▶ Read more on the AP investigation into sexual misconduct inside the FBI</p><p>Kennedy is set to appear before the Senate health committee</p><p>All eyes will be on the chairman of the committee, Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and his opening remarks.</p><p>At Wednesday’s Senate Finance Committee, it was Cassidy who pressed Kennedy the most. When asking him to detail his plans for Medicare and Medicaid, Kennedy responded with few answers and misstated some basic facts about how the federally funded programs work and how many people they serve.</p><p>Cassidy’s vote is crucial for Kennedy since he also serves on the finance committee that will decide whether the health secretary nominee makes it to the Senate floor.</p><p>Vance posts a message sending condolences in response to DC plane crash</p><p>Vice President JD Vance posted a message on Truth Social sending condolences after officials confirmed all passengers on the American Airlines jet that collided with an Army helicopter near DC had died.</p><p>“A heartbreaking tragedy for Wichita, and for our entire country,” he said. “Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them.”</p><p>Takeaways from RFK Jr.’s first confirmation hearing</p><p>Kennedy was pressed to clarify his views on vaccines, abortion and public health priorities he tried to make the case to become Trump’s health secretary.</p><p>Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee expressed hope Kennedy could help reduce chronic diseases and health care costs. Democrats repeatedly used Kennedy's own quotes and transcripts from his books and public appearances to pin him down on issues including vaccines and abortion.</p><p>▶ Read more about some of the key takeaways from Kennedy’s first confirmation hearing.</p><p>Why does RFK Jr. get two confirmation hearings?</p><p>To get to the U.S. Senate for a vote of his nomination, Kennedy needs to hearings before the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee as well as the finance committee.</p><p>Oversight of the Health and Human Services agencies is shared between the two committees. The finance committee is involved because the sprawling $1.7 trillion agency is responsible for a huge part of the nation’s economy — overseeing insurance for nearly half the country, funneling billions of dollars to the states for Medicaid and providing health insurance for the nation’s older Americans through Medicare.</p><p>Meanwhile, the HELP committee also has oversight of the agency’s program and agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Who is Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead the FBI?</p><p>Patel spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration’s attention as a Capitol Hill staffer who helped investigate the Russia probe.</p><p>Patel has called for dramatically reducing the agency’s footprint, a perspective that sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau.</p><p>And though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters’ phone records during leak investigations, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters. He will appear before the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Who is Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for DNI Secretary?</p><p>Gabbard is a former Democratic House member from Hawaii who has been accused of echoing Russian propaganda.</p><p>She unsuccessfully sought the 2020 presidential nomination and left the party in 2022. Gabbard endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him.</p><p>Gabbard has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait. If confirmed, she would come to the role as an outsider compared with her predecessor, Avril Haines, who spent several years in top national security and intelligence positions. She will appear before the Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Today’s confirmation hearing schedule</p><p>The nominations process for Trump’s appointees is picking up pace, with some confirmed by the Senate and other hearings scheduled for more of his Cabinet picks.</p><p>Here’s the schedule for Thursday Jan. 30:</p><p><ul> <p>  4. 9:30 a.m.:     Kash Patel    , FBI </p> <p>  5. 10 a.m.:     Tulsi Gabbard    , Office of the Director of National Intelligence </p> <p>  6. 10 a.m.:     Robert F. Kennedy Jr.    , Heath and Human Services </p></ul></p>
