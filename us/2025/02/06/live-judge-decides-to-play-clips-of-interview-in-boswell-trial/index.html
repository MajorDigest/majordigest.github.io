<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>COURT ENTERED A 15-MINUTE RECESS AT 10:50 AM</strong></p>



<p>SULLIVAN COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) - The second day of Megan Boswell's murder trial began with Judge Jim Goodwin's answer to a dispute that sent the jury to their hotel early on Wednesday.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Judge rules on interview dispute</h3>



<p>Court resumed at 8:30 a.m. Thursday with Goodwin's decision to play portions of a police interview referenced by a witness Wednesday that led to a request by Boswell's defense attorney Gene Scott. The jury is expected back at 9 a.m. News Channel 11 will continue to stream the trial on WJHL.com.</p>



<p>"For the fundamental fairness issue, I'm going to find that the entire video is going to be allowed," Goodwin said.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>Megan Boswell faces 19 charges, including one count of first-degree murder and two counts of felony murder, in the death of her infant daughter Evelyn Boswell's death. Opening statements were heard Wednesday, and the first witness was called; however, a legal dispute ended court early.</p>



<p>Judge Jim Goodwin <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/search-for-evelyn/megan-boswell-murder-trial-begins-with-opening-statements/"><strong>dismissed the jurors around 2:40 p.m. Wednesday</strong></a> after Boswell's attorney requested that he be able to cross-examine Tennessee Bureau of Investigation special agent and witness Brian Fraley about a Feb. 2020 interview he said he had with the defendant. Fraley was the first witness called in the trial.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>While Deputy District Attorney William Harper was examining Fraley on Wednesday, Fraley described the clothes Boswell had told authorities that her infant daughter had been wearing and said those perfectly matched what investigators found her in when her remains were recovered.</p>



<p>Fraley also told the court that Boswell told investigators that she knew Evelyn was dead during that interview. The court entered a recess shortly after that, and Boswell's defense attorney, Gene Scott, told Goodwin he had a request prior to the jury's return.</p>



<p>Scott asked to be able to cross examine Fraley about the interview since its introduction to the court, to which Harper argued that he had not mislead the witness and that Fraley had offered more information than what he was questioned about. Harper also contested saying no formal evidence or statement was introduced. Scott hoped to make the entire interview available to jurors.</p>



<p>"It's my position that the jury should hear it. The state believes it's hearsay," Scott told News Channel 11 after Wednesday's proceedings. "The judge will make that decision, and we'll move on."</p>



<p>Scott tied the request back to one of the first things the state did on Wednesday when they moved to dismiss Count 18 against Boswell, one of her numerous False Report charges. </p>



<p>The move frustrated Goodwin, who said the matter should have been addressed in pre-trial hearings. Goodwin decided that in order to make a fair ruling and ensure there were no issues when it came time for appeals, he needed to watch the entire 2-hour interview and consider the law.</p>



<p>On Thursday morning, Goodwin told both legal teams he had decided to play portions of the interview for the jury and would allow Scott to cross-examine Fraley.</p>



<p>"Mr. Scott, when you cross-examine, Special Agent Fraley, you're allowed to play that video and comply with the rule of completeness," Goodwin said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The video plays</h3>



<p>Scott began to cross-examine Fraley and quickly launched into playing portions of the interview on the screen for the jury.</p>



<p>On the first day of Boswell's trial, the state had dismissed a count of false report against her, Count 18. According to the presentment of charges, Count 18 alleged that Boswell told investigators on Feb. 25, 2020 that Evelyn died after either her or Wood rolled over onto her while sleeping and that she did not know where the body was.</p>



<p>The video played for the court shows portions of that interview between Fraley, Boswell and Sullivan County detectives.</p>



<p>In the video, Boswell can be heard crying and speaking to police. She described a onesie and blanket that Evelyn had been wearing when she said she last saw her.</p>



<p>Fraley can be heard asking Boswell about Evelyn's whereabouts and additional information in the Feb. 25, 2020 interview. She makes references to her ex-boyfriend taking Evelyn away, and at one point says she woke to find Evelyn not breathing.</p>



<p>Boswell claimed Evelyn's eyes were open but not bloodshot or bruised. She said the baby was not cold when she discovered her, nor was she crying or making noise. She also claimed that when she found Evelyn not breathing, she attempted to give her CPR but to no avail. Boswell told police on Feb. 25, 2020 that she was not sure what day Evelyn had died.</p>



<p>She claimed in the interview that she did not know where her then-boyfriend, Hunter Wood, had taken the baby or how he had disposed of the body.</p>



<p>"Megan, you've lied to us for six days now. I need you to be truthful with me today," Fraley said in the interview.</p>



<p>Boswell said in the interview that she was afraid to call anyone and did not want to know what Wood had done with Evelyn. She told Fraley then that Wood had left when it was near dark and returned when it was dark.</p>



<p>She suggested to police that they go search her father Tommy Boswell's property, but she said she did not know where Evelyn would be there. While being interviewed, she claimed that she had wrapped Evelyn's body in a blanket because she "didn't want her to be cold."</p>



<p>Boswell told investigators in the interview that she believed Wood would have taken the body to somewhere near the docks at her father's property. </p>



<p>Throughout the video, Boswell can be heard telling Fraley that she did not know where Evelyn was for certain.</p>



<p>When asked what Wood would say if police were to talk to them about what she said in the interview, Boswell said he had warned her not to say anything and that he did not want to go back to jail. She also claimed they had not been dating long and had only met in December when she applied for a job.</p>



<p>Boswell told Fraley that Wood had a limited relationship with Evelyn, having barely interacted with her. She said in the interview that Evelyn had slept in the bed between herself and Wood one time. </p>



<p>Fraley then brought out a map of Tommy Boswell's property and had her mark places she thought Evelyn might be. He also had her reiterate what she had been wearing, which Fraley testified on Wednesday matched the description of the onesie and blanket she was found in.</p>



<p>Boswell told investigators she assumed they would arrest her after she told them Evelyn was dead. Fraley told her she had not been helping herself, but that the authorities were focused on finding Evelyn. </p>



<p>Fraley told her it would be best for her to tell the truth so that he could tell the district attorney's office that she had stopped lying and helped investigators find Evelyn. He also noted that it did not look good after she had gone on the news and made comments about the TBI.</p>



<p>He reiterated in the interview that she was not under arrest at the time and said multiple times that she had to tell the truth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cross-examination begins</h3>



<p>After the video concluded, Scott began cross-examining Fraley. Scott moved that the video be added as an exhibit of evidence.</p>



<p>He asked Fraley to specify when Boswell told investigators that Evelyn was dead. Fraley testified that he already had that in his notes because she had informed other investigators that the baby was dead.</p>



<p>Fraley confirmed that Evelyn's mother, Angela Boswell, was brought to the interview and could be seen in the video. He also clarified that the "he" repeatedly referenced in the interview was Hunter Wood.</p>



<p>A technical issue at the courthouse briefly interrupted the live stream of the court proceedings.</p>



<p>Scott began asking Fraley questions about the discovery of Evelyn's body. He said he realized there was more weight to the trash can than normal and had removed some of the top items, at which point he saw Evelyn's leg. He then said he waited for forensic teams to arrive for the removal of her body.</p>



<p>Fraley recalled finding a bread bag in the trash bag with a date that gave investigators an idea of how long it had been there. He continued to answer Scott's questions about how Evelyn's body was found and placed onto a body bag that police had set on the front porch of the playhouse.</p>



<p>Scott showed Fraley one of the photos entered into evidence on Wednesday of the playhouse. He asked Fraley to use a pointer to show the jury where the body bag was placed on the porch, which Fraley did.</p>



<p>Scott asked Fraley to clarify if there was a pile of wire on the front porch, which was also visible in another photo that Scott had entered into evidence. Fraley said yes, it looked to be wire. After Fraley identified a photo of Evelyn's body being removed from the trash can, Scott asked him what had been done with the wire since it was no longer in the same spot.</p>



<p>Fraley answered that the wire had been moved to create room for body bag as Evelyn's body was removed. He confirmed that there did appear to be some leaves and grass or hay underneath the wire. Fraley also pointed out some pupae that he said appeared to be visible. Fraley mentioned pupae, a form of insects between larvae and adult, repeatedly in his Wednesday testimony by stating there had been multiple found with Evelyn's partially decayed remains.</p>



<p>Scott asked Fraley to confirm that Evelyn was found in a trash bag inside the trash can, which he did. However, Fraley did not remember seeing leaves in Evelyn's hair when removing her from the trash can.</p>



<p>During his testimony, Fraley said as minimal movement was done as possible once investigators realized Evelyn was in the trash can. He maintained that once the blanket in the trash can was removed and the order of decay was noticed, investigators stopped removing the items and made an effort to prevent the body from being moved inside the trash can.</p>



<p>Scott asked if it was possible, despite the care investigators took, that Evelyn's body could have moved inside the trash can. Fraley said it could have.</p>



<p>Scott then moved on to the collection of evidence at Tommy Boswell's property. Fraley confirmed he did collect several items himself and estimated it could be dozens. </p>



<p>Scott had no further questions.</p>



<p>Deputy District Attorney William Harper began his redirect and asked about the position of a black trash bag in the can that had to be removed before Evelyn was found. Fraley said the other bags in the can had been "compressed" and appeared to have been pushed down.</p>



<p>In answer to Harper's question, Fraley stated the body was carefully treated and the can was handled gently once they were sure Evelyn was in it.</p>



<p>Scott had one further question about the position of the trash can that Fraley answered.</p>



<p>Fraley was released but remains a subpoenaed witness and could return to the stand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tommy Boswell called to the stand</h3>



<p>The second witness called by the state was Boswell's father and Evelyn's grandfather, Tommy Boswell.</p>



<p>Harper had Boswell confirm his Muddy Creek property as his home and his relation to both Boswell and Evelyn. He also confirmed that Angela Boswell, ex-wife since 2016, is Megan Boswell's mother.</p>



<p>Tommy Boswell said his daughter stayed primarily with his parents, who live on the same property as him.</p>



<p>He also pinned Megan Boswell's time spent in the foster care system on her mother and Boswell not going to school. Tommy Boswell also confirmed that Evelyn was born while Megan Boswell was in foster care.</p>



<p>Harper asked Tommy Boswell about what it was like when his daughter later came back to live with him, and he described supporting her, buying her a car and helping her with expenses for Evelyn.</p>



<p>Tommy Boswell said Megan and Evelyn lived with him for a few months, but Megan did not clean her room. Between that and the other people living in the house, including his fiance at the time and other children, he had Megan leave. He testified that he thinks Megan stayed with his mother briefly afterward.</p>



<p>Harper placed a diagram of Tommy Boswell's property up on the screen and had him identify various structures.</p>



<p>After Megan stayed with his mother, Tommy Boswell said Megan went to live in a trailer park that is owned by their family. He told Harper that Megan was gifted a trailer and did not have to pay bills. As far as he knew, only Megan and Evelyn lived there.</p>



<p>Tommy Boswell said he had tried to push several details out of his mind after struggling to recall some things. He then began to cry and grabbed a tissue as Harper asked him to describe the state of the trailer when he visited. According to Tommy, there did come a time when he informed Megan that if she was going to live with Hunter Wood, she needed to move out so the trailer could be rented.</p>



<p>Tommy said the trailer required heavy cleaning after Megan moved out. He himself did not clean it out, but he noted that several things were hauled away and part of the floor required replacing. </p>



<p>As far as he knew, Tommy said he believed Megan was living with Wood then. When she moved out of the trailer park, Tommy said he had not yet met Wood. He claimed he did not meet Wood until after Christmas in 2020 on a trip to Pigeon Forge.</p>



<p>Evelyn was not with Megan on that trip, which Tommy said he found unusual. Tommy testified that Megan claimed the baby was with Ethan Perry, an ex-boyfriend that she claimed was Evelyn's father. Tommy said he had not seen Evelyn since Thanksgiving.</p>



<p>After the trip, Tommy said he saw Megan only a few times but never Evelyn. When he asked her where Evelyn was, Tommey claimed Megan continued to say she was with Perry. That ultimately led him to giving her an ultimatum so he could see his granddaughter, Tommy told Harper.</p>



<p>He described calling the Department of Children Services (DCS) and telling them how long it had been since he saw his granddaughter. After reporting it to DCS, Tommy said it was not long before law enforcement met with him.</p>



<p>Tommy told the court he complied with law enforcement "100%." After getting law enforcement involved in February 2020, Tommy said he stayed in touch with police throughout the search for Evelyn.</p>



<p>Harper asked Tommy about March 6, 2020, the day Evelyn was found. He claimed that Megan and his then-fiance, Ashley Rosenbalm, used to swap phones often. Tommy claimed that they thought law enforcement could use the phones and also began recalling a time he saw a vehicle backed up to a shed on his property its door open.</p>



<p>When law enforcement arrived, they looked at the shed, and he also suggested they check out the playhouse, which Tommy's father had built for Megan in the 2000s with leftover lumber from a barn. Tommy did not recall ever knowing of anyone being in the playhouse since Evelyn had gone missing.</p>



<p>Tommy also described how his property can be accessed. He told the jury there is a fence and gate that requires a key fob to open. He said that Megan did have access, but he never gave a fob to Wood.</p>



<p>He also did not recall Wood ever being on his property without Megan.</p>



<p>Harper then began using drone footage of Tommy's property taken by the Sullivan County Sheriff's Office as evidence. Harper showed the drone footage, which begins at the gate to the property, to the jury.</p>



<p>A trailer on the property was labeled in the video as "O'Mommy's," which Tommy clarified was a nickname for his mother that the Boswell family used. He also clarified that a camper seen in the drone footage was not on the property in 2020.</p>



<p>Before Scott began asking Tommy his questions, Goodwin sent the court into a 15-minute recess.</p>
