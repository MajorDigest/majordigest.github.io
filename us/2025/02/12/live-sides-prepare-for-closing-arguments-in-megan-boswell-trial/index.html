<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>COURT IS IN RECESS FOR LUNCH, AFTER WHICH CLOSING ARGUMENTS WILL BEGIN</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">SULLIVAN COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) — One week after its start, the end of Megan Boswell's murder trial is nearing its end as both legal teams rested their cases on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>Boswell herself will not testify in the trial.</p>



<p>Before the prosecution and defense give their closing arguments and the jury begins deliberations, Judge Jim Goodwin charged the jury and read off instructions.</p>



<p>Boswell faces 19 charges in the death of her baby daughter, Evelyn Boswell. Her charges include first-degree murder, two counts of felony murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated child neglect,abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, failure to report a death under suspicious, unusual or unnatural circumstances and 11 counts of false reports.</p>



<p>She had faced 20 total charges prior to the trial, but the state dismissed one count of false reports on the first day court was held.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>Evelyn was found on Boswell’s father’s property on March 6, 2020.</p>



<p>Since her trial began, dozens of witnesses have taken the stand. Friends and family of Boswell, law enforcement who interviewed her, medical examiners and forensic scientists have all testified in the trial.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prosecution Rests</h3>



<p>When the trial resumed Wednesday morning, Deputy District Attorney William Harper said the state sought to introduce an involuntary order from a court in Virginia that ordered a mental health evaluation of Hunter Wood. Harper also entered a letter from the Southwest Virginia Mental Health Institute stating that Wood had been involuntarily committed.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>After those documents were entered into evidence, Goodwin asked Harper who the state would call as its next witness.</p>



<p>"Judge, the state would rest," Harper told the court.</p>



<p>The jury was sent from the courtroom.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Defense asks for acquittal</h3>



<p>With the jury out of the room, Boswell's attorney, Gene Scott, moved for a judgement of acquittal of charges and went through the counts for Judge Jim Goodwin.</p>



<p>Scott maintianed there was no proof of pre-meditation in Evelyn's death and said the medical examiners were unable to give specific causes as to how the child died.</p>



<p>"As it relates to the first three homicide counts, the state has failed to prove the cause of death, which is required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt," Scott said. "I understand the burden here is that the state has to prove it in a light most favorable to the state, the court has to look at it from that standpoint."</p>



<p>Scott pointed to his cross-examination of Dr. Matrina Schmidt, who conducted Evelyn's autopsy, on Tuesday. Scott told Goodwin that while she testified she believed Evelyn's cause of death to be asphyxiation, it was possible her death could have been caused by sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a heart issue or another medical issue.</p>



<p>"She really couldn't specify the manner of death," Scott said. "When it comes to [Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polschan], she testified that she felt like it was asphyxia caused by being placed in the trash can, but ultimately, she did answer that she could not conclusively say that the baby was alive or dead before being placed in the trash can.</p>



<p>"As it relates to Count 1 and pre-medititation, there is no evidence whatsoever of pre-meditation."</p>



<p>Scott also claimed the state has not produced any proof to back up the child abuse or neglect charges; instead, he argued the testimony of multiple friends and Evelyn's pediatrician suggest Boswell had been a good mother. </p>



<p>"As it relates to tampering with evidence, I'll leave that to the court's good discretion," Scott said. "False report, obviously, as it relates to those there is a double jeopardy issue that the court will have to address if the jury returns multiple verdicts on those, but I will leave those for now."</p>



<p>Harper argued against Scott and said the proof was sufficient given how Evelyn was found and based on the testimony of two medical examiners.</p>



<p>"As far as Mr. Scott's argument regarding pre-meditation, I think the proof's been pretty clear in this case," Harper said. "The child was found upside down stuffed into a trash can with its head wrapped in a blanket and then on top of that, there was a substantial amount of aluminum foil. I think that clearly shows an intent to murder so we would argue that the element of pre-meditation is at least shown through the physical evidence in this case."</p>



<p>He reminded Goodwin that both Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polschan's opinions were that Evelyn's death was homicide by asphyxiation.</p>



<p>"Mr. Scott certainly challenged them and threw some other possibilities out there, but at the end of the day, that was their opinion as to the cause and manner of death," Harper said. "So I believe the proof has been sufficient at this point to show how the child died and to let the jury make decisions on all the remaining counts."</p>



<p>Goodwin was required to address each of the charges that Scott asked for acquittal of as he made his ruling. </p>



<p>He said that the way in which Evelyn was found (upside down in a trash can), Boswell's behavior on social media, the volumes of evidence, Boswell's different stories about what happened were all contributing factors in his decision.</p>



<p>Goodwin ruled that it was for the jury to make a verdict on all of the counts. He denied Scott's motion for acquittal.</p>



<p>When asked by Goodwin, Scott confirmed that Boswell would not testify before the jury. </p>

<p>"Judge, we're prepared to state at this time that the defendant will not be testifying," Scott said.</p>



<p>Boswell was given a microphone to state for the record that she understood she had a right not to testify, that the jury could not hold it against her if she did not testify and that it was her decision not to take the stand.</p>



<p>"After consulting with me and looking at the evidence and hearing the proof here in court, have you made a decision as to whether or not you want to testify?" Scott asked her.</p>



<p>"Yes, I have," Boswell responded.</p>



<p>"Do you want to testify," Scott asked.</p>



<p>"No."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Defense Rests</h3>



<p>The jury was brought back into the courtroom. </p>



<p>Goodwin informed the jurors that Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polschan's "parting shot" at the end of her testimony, in which she said Evelyn "could have been murdered a different way" was not to be considered. He told them that murder is a legal term outside of her expertise.</p>



<p>Scott then informed the jury that the defense rested its case.</p>



<p>According to Goodwin, the court needed to enter an extended break to prepare the charge for the jury while the both sides readied their closing arguments. The jury was sent from the courtroom for a 45-minute to an hour recess.</p>

<p>Around 10:45 a.m., Goodwin and the legal teams returned to the courtroom. Both sides told Goodwin they agreed to the jury charge as written. </p>



<p>Goodwin told them he would read part of the 81-page document to the jury before closing arguments began. He read the charges back to the jury and gave them their instructions.</p>



<p>The jury could convict Boswell on lesser charges than those the state has levied against her. Goodwin reminded the jury of the burden of proof and the requirements for each charge.</p>



<p>Goodwin showed a black book to jurors and told them how to fill it out once they selected a foreman and reached a verdict.</p>



<p>The jury's verdict must be unanimous.</p>



<p>If Boswell is convicted of any of her murder charges, a sentencing hearing will begin immediately afterward. The Second Judicial District Attorney General's Office previously told Goodwin they were seeking life in prison without the possibility of parole for Boswell if she was convicted.</p>



<p>After Goodwin read through his instructions, the jury was released for lunch. When the trial resumes, the prosecution and defense will give their closing arguments. After the closing arguments, Goodwin will provide final instructions, and the jury will begin its deliberations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prosecution's Closing Argument</h3>



<p>When court resumed shortly after 1:15 p.m., both sides gave their closing arguments. Goodwin warned those in attendance that if there were any outbursts, he would clear the courtroom.</p>



<p>Assistant District Attorney Amber Massengill delivered her closing argument to the jury on behalf of the prosecution. She asked the jurors to turn to the portion of their booklets that covered the definition of the burden of proof that must be met.</p>



<p>As an example, Massengill help up a large pad of paper with the phrase "Co_ _on Sense" and likened it to Wheel of Fortune. She told jurors they did not have to have every single piece of the puzzle in front of them in order to rest easy with their decision.</p>



<p>Massengill also told the jury that the words Scott used were not evidence, saying he threw out ideas to plant in the jury's mind. She said Scott used ideas like tin foil hats and SIDS to throw off the jury. She warned them against considering Scott's questions about cadaver dogs and Hunter Wood.</p>



<p>Scott did object at one point, and the legal teams briefly approached the bench. Goodwin reminded the jury that the defense did not have to prove anything and that the burden of proof was on the prosecution.</p>



<p>Massengill reminded them of Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polschan's testimony when she told Scott that a child had not died in Tennessee of SIDS in years.</p>



<p>She showed the jury a photo of Evelyn that she said was likely the last one ever taken of the child by her babysitter, Sue Whitson. Massengill reminded the jury of Evelyn's missed pediatrician appointment on Dec. 5.</p>



<p>Massengill told the jury that from early December 2019 on, Boswell continued to tell family and friends that Evelyn was with Ethan Perry, her alleged father. Then in February 2020, Tommy Boswell decided that enough time had passed and contacted the Department of Children's Services. She recounted the testimony of DCS Investigator James Lewis, who met Boswell at Wood's family's home after Tommy Boswell reported Evelyn missing.</p>



<p>Massengill said that up until Dec. 3, 2019, she sent Ethan Perry, the man previously believed to be Evelyn's father, photos of the child. </p>



<p>In her argument, Massengill said the only reason Boswell spent time in foster care was because of her own actions and admonished the way she kept the trailer - which her family provided for her - while living with her daughter.</p>



<p>She told the jury that all of Boswell's friends, family and acquaintances who testified were also victims of Boswell's lies and crimes. Massengill said Boswell blamed other people around her rather than coming clean about what happened to Evelyn. </p>



<p>Rather than following the defense's ideas that Wood was more involved, Massengill advised jurors to consider it more likely that Boswell was the one who took Evelyn's remains and belongings to Tommy Boswell's property in her own car.</p>



<p>Massengill told jurors that even after Evelyn was dead and decomposing in a trash can, Boswell described Evelyn as "mean as [expletive]."</p>



<p>Massengill said Boswell cried throughout the trial "because she had an audience," but she pointed to other evidence the prosecution claims proved that Boswell had moved on with her life after Evelyn's death.</p>



<p>Massengill put multiple photos Boswell posted or had depicting her life after Evelyn's death, many of which featured her with Wood on trips.</p>



<p>"She doesn't look very sad to me," Massengill said.</p>



<p>Massengill asked the jury to show Boswell that her stories and actions have caught up with her. She told them to consider the medical examiner testimonies, in which Dr. Mileusnic-Polschan said there was no reason Evelyn should be dead aside from homicide. </p>



<p>She also harkened back to the forensic evidence that was provided, showing Boswell and Evelyn as the only people whose DNA were confirmed to be in the trash can. Massengill recounted the Special Agent David Hoover of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigantion's findings, which found Boswell's fingerprints on the trash can, trash bag and aluminum foil that was wrapped around Evelyn's head.</p>



<p>Massengill claimed Boswell "essentially mummified" her daughter and threw her out in the trash.</p>



<p>She told the jury Scott wanted the jury to discount the testimony and findings of Dr. Matrina Schmidt and Dr. Mileusnic-Polschan. Instead, she asked jurors to remember all of the findings the two doctors shared and their professional opinions as to how Evelyn died.</p>



<p>Toward the end of her argument, Massengill showed part of the verdict form to the jury. Massengill told jurors that if they agree on Boswell's guilt, there was no need to consider any of the lesser charges levied against her. She reminded jurors of the definition of pre-meditation and said there was "nothing about this case that was not pre-meditated."</p>



<p>Massengill walked through each of the charges against Boswell, noting when she reached the false report charges that the defendant admitted herself in some of the videos seen that she had told incorrect stories about what happened to Evelyn.</p>



<p>"Evelyn mattered. She deserved to grow up," Massengill said.</p>



<p>She reiterated the prosecution's stance that Boswell alone was to blame for Evelyn's death.</p>



<p>"She failed her daughter," Massengill said.</p>



<p>Massengill said there would be parts of the case that would likely never be known but that there was enought evidence to proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Boswell was guilty.</p>



<p>"Megan Boswell should not be allowed to go on as if Evelyn never existed," Massengill said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Defense's Closing Argument</h3>



<p>Scott began his argument by thanking the jurors for being part of the trial. He told them there was a lot of emotion in the case and said Massengill was good at eliciting emotion. However, he said the trial was about the facts not the emotions.</p>



<p>Scott told the jury that the state would have them convict Boswell based on her behavior after Evelyn's death. </p>



<p>He began to run through witness testimonies, starting with Casey Saults, who worked at the pediatrician's office Boswell took Evelyn to. He reminded them that up until the missed appointment, Boswell took her daughter to every appointment.</p>



<p>Scott said the testimonies of Paul Miller, Audrey Gibbs and Bailey Hawkins suggested that Boswell was not a bad mother and that there was no evidence she had been abusing Evelyn. He refuted claims by the prosecution that Boswell's home life did not factor into her behavior.</p>



<p>He continued to bring back up witness testimonies, like those of Gail Kyte, Katelyn Carter and Erica Stacy. In those, he repeated that there were never signs of abuse that caused any of them to be concerned about Evelyn.</p>



<p>Scott brought up Perry and said there was no proof that Boswell did not know herself that Perry wasn't Evelyn's father. </p>



<p>He also reminded them of Randy Wood, Hunter Wood's father. Scott said Randy Wood's testimony was the first the jury learned of his mental issues, and Scott told them he had no grand conspiracy theory about Hunter Wood.</p>



<p>Scott said he thought it was strange that Wood did not supply his DNA to investigators if he had nothing to hide. He tied in previous questions he asked about schizophrenic patients and their thoughts on aluminum foil to what could have potentially happened to Evelyn.</p>



<p>He claimed he was not trying to villify Wood but that it could not be ruled out.</p>



<p>Scott turned to his Tuesday cross-examination of the medical examiners. He reminded the jury that Dr. Schmidt conceded that it was possible Evelyn could have died from other causes aside from asphyxiation. In regard to Dr. Mileusnic-Polschan, he described her as evasive and told the jury that she came in as a witness with a pre-conceived notion.</p>



<p>Scott said Dr. Schmidt's testimony leaves open other causes of death. He told the jury that Boswell should have reported Evelyn's death, which he said in his opening statement. While he admitted the state has proven she lied at times, Scott said they have not proven she is a murderer.</p>



<p>"You can't judge someone by how they grieve," Scott said. He became loud demanding no one can tell someone how to grieve if they lose a child, especially when they have not lived a life like Boswell's.</p>



<p>He insisted with a raised voice that the prosecution has not been able to prove that Boswell murdered Evelyn.</p>



<p>Scott brought out a roll of aluminum foil and tore off a piece, saying Boswell's fingerprint could have been left on it from a previous use and also handled by someone else when wrapped around Evelyn's head.</p>



<p>Scott told the jury that he wagered every one of their fingerprints were on their own trash cans so that did not prove Boswell killed Evelyn.</p>



<p>Scott reminded the jury of a Feb. 25, 2020 interview Boswell had with TBI Special Agent Brian Fraley. In that interview, Boswell told him she did not know where Evelyn was but it could be at Tommy Boswell's. Scott said Fraley knew Boswell was a scared young mother when who was told there would be a conversation with the district attorney's office.</p>



<p>Referring back to TBI Special Agent Marla Gray's testimony about DNA analysis, Scott said male DNA, while not identifiable, was found inside some gloves found in the trash can.</p>



<p>He returned to the subject of Hunter Wood and messages between him and Boswell that were shown to the jury. Scott said Wood's messages expressing concern for Evelyn were "self-serving" and were a way of showing people that he had no involvement. Again, he reminded the jury that Wood never supplied his DNA.</p>



<p>"If your questions are not answered to your satisfaction, that's reasonable doubt," Scott advised.</p>



<p>"I pray you come to the right decision," he concluded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Harper's Closing Argument</h3>



<p>Harper made his own closing argument and said Scott, like his client, seemed to have a lot of convenient answers.</p>



<p>According to Harper, the issue with Scott's argument was that it would require the jury to believe Boswell, who he described as a known liar and a master manipulator.</p>



<p>He said Scott's claim that the Feb. 25, 2020 was the point at which Boswell decided to tell the truth was not believable. Harper said law enforcement planted the seed in Boswell's mind that if she claimed Evelyn died in an accident, they could learn something about the child's whereabouts.</p>



<p>Harper said there was a moment when she told the truth. She told investigators in an interview that something happened before Dec. 21, 2020.</p>



<p>"She murdered her child. That's what happened before Dec. 21," Harper said.</p>



<p>Harper said it would be a remarkable coincidence that at the same time Boswell, who was living in a dirty trailer as a single mother, started working at the same restaurant as Wood, whose family had resources and a home by a lake, Evelyn stopped appearing with her in public.</p>



<p>He asked the jury to use their common sense and consider the testimonies of the friends, previous babysitters and Evelyn's pediatrician who all said Boswell would not produce Evelyn after. Harper said she could not face what she had done.</p>



<p>Harper said it was "unbelievable" that the defense was still attempting to tie Wood to Evelyn's death when no evidence was ever shown in the trial that suggested that.</p>



<p>He said Boswell would have them believe that Wood, who lived in a nice house, would come over to her dirty trailer to spend the night and then rolled over Evelyn while sleeping.</p>



<p>Harper told the jury it was a stretch of the imagination that Wood would then take Evelyn's body to her father's property and put the trash can in her old playhouse.</p>



<p>In regards to the fingerprints, Harper said the most likely person to have handled the foil and bag are the person's who were found: Megan Boswell's. He reminded the jury that no other fingerprints, including Wood's, were found on any items, nor was any DNA found that could have potentially tied Wood to Evelyn's death.</p>



<p>Harper told the jury that Scott wanted them to believe the messages between Boswell and Wood were contrived, but again, Harper said there was no evidence of that. Harper said that the responses from Wood do not reflect that of someone who was complicit in a baby's death.</p>



<p>Further, Harper reiterated that believing Wood was involved would require believing Boswell.</p>



<p>He reminded them that three doctors all testified that Evelyn was a healthy baby and that her pediatrician's only concern was that the child did not show up for an appointment. Harper said Evelyn's pediatrician was not worried about a heart issue or being tongue-tied, which Scott suggested could be a cause of death.</p>



<p>Harper referenced the testimonies of the medical examiners, who confidently reported that Evelyn died by asphyxiation and found it highly unlikely that Evelyn died due to someone rolling over onto her in her seat.</p>



<p>He vehemently reminded the jury that the foil was tightly wrapped and pressed to Evelyn's head and the amount found proved the intent behind its use.</p>



<p>"All of this could have been avoided, but Megan Boswell only cares about one person, and that's Megan Boswell," Harper said, noting that other people, some of whom testified, would have taken in and cared for Evelyn.</p>
