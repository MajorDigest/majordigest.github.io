    <p>Sylvester Turner, the former mayor of Houston and newly elected U.S. congressman, has passed away at the age of 70.</p><h3><b>Turner Family Statement</b></h3><p><i>It is with inexpressible sadness that we the family of Congressman Sylvester Turner, Representative for the 18th Congressional District of Texas, acknowledge his unexpected passing.</i></p><p><i>After attending the State of The Union Address in Washington, D.C. last evening, Congressman Turner was taken to the hospital and he was later released.</i></p><p><i>On Wednesday, March 5 at approximately 5:45am he died at his home from enduring health complications. The Turner family is requesting fervent prayers from all who knew and loved him. We also request the public’s respect for our family’s privacy as we process this difficult reality.</i></p><p><i>Official communication will come from his staff at the appropriate time. Congressman Turner was the consummate public servant. But to us, he was our beloved father, grandfather, sibling, and relative. Thank you for your prayers.</i></p><p><i>More information regarding services will be forthcoming.</i></p><h3><b>Statement from the Office of Congressman Sylvester Turner</b></h3><p><i>It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Congressman Sylvester Turner, who died peacefully today at the age of 70. Born on September 27, 1954, in Houston’s Acres Homes neighborhood, Congressman Turner dedicated his life to public service and the betterment of his community. He graduated as valedictorian from Klein High School in 1973, earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of Houston in 1977, and obtained a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1980. In 1983, Turner co-founded the law firm Barnes &amp; Turner, specializing in corporate and commercial law. His political career began in 1988 when he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives for District 139, a position he held for 27 years. During his tenure, he served 21 years on the House Appropriations Committee and six years as Speaker Pro Tempore, playing a pivotal role in shaping state fiscal policy and balancing multiple budgets. In 2015, Turner was elected as Houston’s 62nd mayor and was re-elected in 2019. As mayor, he led the city through significant challenges, including seven federally declared natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2025, Turner continued his public service by representing Texas’s 18th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives serving on the powerful House Homeland Security and Science, Space and Technology Committees. Throughout his career, he was known for his bipartisan leadership, dedication to his constituents, and unwavering commitment to improving the lives of all Houstonians. Congressman Turner is survived by his loving family, devoted staff and numerous friends who cherished his wisdom, humor, and steadfast dedication to public service. Details regarding memorial services will be announced in the coming days. The family is asking for privacy during this difficult time.</i></p><h3><b>Lina Hidalgo speaks</b></h3><p>Several hours after Turner’s passing was announced, KPRC 2′s Rilwan Balogun spoke to Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who worked with Turner for years during his political pursuits in Houston.</p><p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2025/03/05/former-houston-mayor-sylvester-turner-passes-away-at-70/"><b>Former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner passes away at 70</b></a></p><p>“Frankly [I am] just in shock, I think it was totally unexpected,” Judge Hidalgo told Balogun. “And it’s a big, big loss for our community. Just a few months ago, we were celebrating his inauguration... Now there’s so many of us mourning his loss.”</p><p>She talked about her work with Turner through some of the area’s toughest hardships—namely 2021 Winter Freeze and the COVID-19 pandemic—as well as the city’s biggest triumphs like the Astros’ 2017 and 2022 World Series runs.</p><p>She reminisced about a phrase she and Turner used to say, emphasizing how the pair beat the odds to achieve success in politics despite their humble backgrounds.</p><p>“How is it possible that a kid from Acres Homes and an immigrant kid become the mayor and county judge in a place as big as Houston and Harris County?” Judge Hidalgo said.</p><p><b>Judge Lina Hidalgo released the following statement:</b></p><p><i>“Our community has lost an irreplaceable leader. I am devastated and shocked by the passing of Congressman Sylvester Turner, who was my governing partner and friend. We often talked about how wonderful it was that a kid from Acres Homes and an immigrant kid could become the mayor and the county executive of communities as large as Houston and Harris County. Mayor Turner and I faced some of the biggest challenges together, from the 2019 ITC fire to Winter Storm Uri. Most significantly, we navigated the COVID-19 pandemic together. We mourned the passing of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee together, and we also enjoyed rodeos and celebrated Astros wins together. I loved him and I appreciated him. On behalf of Harris County, I offer my condolences to his family and friends, all those he represented throughout his career, and the residents of the 18th Congressional District”</i></p><h3><b>Other tributes</b></h3><p>Turner, who devoted more than three decades to public service, is being remembered with tributes from both political figures and citizens.</p><p><b>Governor Abbott:</b></p><p><i>“Cecilia and I are saddened to hear of the passing of Congressman Sylvester Turner. Congressman Turner was a man of character who served his fellow Texans for more than 36 years. From his time as State Representative, to Mayor of Houston, and finally representing Texas’ 18th Congressional District, Congressman Turner leaves behind a legacy of service to our great state. Congressman Turner will be missed, and our prayers go out to his family and loved ones during this time of grief.”</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2025/03/05/ive-lost-a-personal-friend-mayor-whitmire-offers-condolences-to-sylvester-turner/"><b>‘I’ve lost a personal friend:’ Mayor Whitmire offers condolences to Sylvester Turner</b></a></li></ul><p><b>Houston Mayor John Whitmire: </b></p><p><i>“I was saddened to learn of the death of Congressman and former Mayor Sylvester Turner. My condolences go out to his daughter, Ashley, and his entire family during this difficult time. I ask Houstonians to keep Rep. Turner’s  family in your thoughts and prayers. The flags on City of Houston buildings have been lowered to half-staff, and City Hall will be illuminated tonight in red, white, and blue in his honor. Later, I will announce how the city plans to celebrate Congressman  Turner’s remarkable life of public service. “Sylvester and I shared a history that went beyond politics. We served together in the Texas Legislature, and he was my state representative for 24 years. We were together in good times and bad times. Over the years, we attended  countless community meetings, church services, and other events. No one has introduced me at public events more than Turner. He asked me to speak at his mother’s funeral, and I was there when Ashley was born, just as he was there when my daughters, Whitney  and Sarah, were born. “This past Saturday, we were both at the Rodeo Houston parade and, two weeks ago, at a church in Acres Homes, where we both spoke and took a picture with the pastor’s family. That’s who he was—always present, always connected  to the community he loved.”Sylvester Turner was the proud son of Acres Home and graduated from Klein High School, the University of Houston, and Harvard Law. He rose from humble beginnings to meet with presidents, kings, and queens, yet he never forgot  where he came from. “We didn’t always agree politically, but we never took things personally. I’ve lost a friend, and our community has lost a true public servant. There will never be another Sylvester Turner. He was a dedicated public servant until  the end. “I hope that, in his memory, we all come together and remember that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.”</i></p><p><b>Harris County Democratic Party:</b></p><p><i>“The Harris County Democratic Party joins Harris County in mourning the passing of Congressman and former Mayor Sylvester Turner, statesman, father, and grandfather, who passed away over night. Congressman Turner was born and raised in Houston’s Acres Homes neighborhood and received his JD from Harvard Law School before returning to Houston to work with and for the people of his hometown. He served Harris County up until his last hours, attending last night’s joint address to Congress. Congressman Turner served in the Texas House of Representatives for decades before becoming mayor of Houston from 2016 to 2024, leading the city through the recovery following Hurricane Harvey. Last year, he cemented his place among storied Texas politicians when he was elected as the congressional representative for District 18, a seat previously held by Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland, Craig Washington, and Sheila Jackson Lee. He leaves a legacy of compassion, dedication, and tireless leadership for the people of Harris County. Our thoughts this morning are with his family.”</i></p><p><b>Harris County Attorney Menefee:</b></p><p><i>“It is hard to put into words the loss of Congressman Sylvester Turner. For nearly four decades, he devoted his life to public service, standing as a pillar of strength, wisdom, and unwavering commitment to Houstonians, residents of the 18th Congressional District, and all Texans.</i></p><p><i>He epitomized remaining calm under pressure, guiding our city through natural disasters and crises with steady leadership. He worked tirelessly to serve every community, ensuring that those too often overlooked had a voice. He stood firm in his convictions, regardless of whether they were popular, because he understood that true leadership isn’t about convenience—it’s about doing what’s right.</i></p><p><i>I saw his relentless advocacy firsthand. As Mayor of Houston, he brought the EPA Administrator to Fifth Ward and Kashmere Gardens to see firsthand the impact of contamination in historically Black neighborhoods. He proudly and publicly fought against the Texas Legislature’s passing of Senate Bill 1, one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. He never backed down from the powerful—whether they sat in the White House, the governor’s mansion, or a corporate boardroom. Because for him, public service wasn’t about accolades. It was about standing up for others.</i></p><p><i>To those of us who served alongside him, he was more than a leader—he was a mentor. He taught us to stand tall, hold our heads high, and walk into any room with confidence, knowing we belonged. But most of all, he was a friend. He answered every call. He encouraged and affirmed you. He told you when you could do better. He gave you a microphone and pushed you to lead.</i></p><p><i>Rest well, Congressman. We are all better because you dedicated your life to serving the public.”</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2025/03/05/share-your-memories-of-former-houston-mayor-sylvester-turner/"><b>Share your memories of Former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner</b></a></li></ul><p><b>Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu:</b></p><p><i>“Sylvester Turner was known as the conscience of the Texas House, bringing moral clarity and a deep commitment to his community back home in Houston to every debate and policy discussion. Rep. Turner’s legacy of fighting for affordable housing, disaster recovery, and criminal justice reform continues to inspire and guide our caucus today. The wisdom, integrity, and strategic vision he brought to public service will continue to inspire generations of Texans committed to building a more just and equitable state.”</i></p><p><b>Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis:</b></p><p><i>“My sincere condolences to Ashley and the Turner family. Houston mourns the loss of our servant leader, proud native son, dedicated father and dear friend. Thank you, Sylvester Turner for all you gave of yourself to serve Houston, Texas, and this nation. We the People are all better off because you chose to dedicate yourself to a life of public service. You also advanced the continuous struggle to make this nation as good as its promise of freedom and justice for all.”</i></p><p><b>Commissioner Adrian Garcia:</b></p><p><i>“The loss of Sylvester Turner leaves an incredible hole in my heart. Despite previously having been opponents, Mayor Turner and I put bygones aside and developed a tremendous partnership between the City of Houston and Harris County that remains today. He gave his life to working for the people of Houston, from his decades in the Texas House, to his two terms as Mayor, and finally as a Congressman. I’m thankful to Mayor/Representative Turner for his many years of public service. Houston is a better home to all of us because of his many years of dedication to serving the people. My heart, thoughts, and prayers go out to his family and all those who loved him”</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2025/03/05/key-highlights-from-sylvester-turners-tenure-as-houston-mayor/"><b>Key highlights from Sylvester Turner’s tenure as Houston mayor</b></a></li></ul><p><b>Harris County Commissioner Lesley Briones:</b></p><p><i>“Congressman Sylvester Turner’s passing is a tremendous loss to our community and country. Congressman Turner was a transformational leader whose presence was felt in every neighborhood he represented, whose career carried the hopes of his community, and whose legacy will resonate for generations. He loved to remind us that in Houston, “If you can dream it, you can do it.” His life demonstrated the truth of those words. He dedicated his career to serving the city he loved, and he never wavered in his conviction that every Houstonian deserves a fair shot.</i></p><p><i>For me, Sylvester Turner was a mentor, a friend, and a partner in delivering progress. He didn’t just serve — he united. He didn’t just lead — he inspired. He knew that real change doesn’t happen in isolation — it happens when people come together, roll up their sleeves, and do the hard work. And that’s exactly what we did. I am forever grateful for his example, his partnership, and his work to improve the lives of Harris County residents.</i></p><p><i>His legacy is embodied by the words of 2 Timothy 4:7: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” Now, it is up to all of us to carry on that work with the same passion, resilience, and commitment to advancing opportunity and justice for all.</i></p><p><i>My heart is with the Congressman’s family, his loved ones, and everyone who had the privilege of knowing him. We mourn today, and we give thanks for a life well lived, a legacy that will endure, and a leader who showed us what’s possible when we believe in the promise of America and fight for it.”</i></p><p><b>Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association President Patrick M. “Marty” Lancton:</b></p><p><i>“The Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association extends its deepest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of U.S. Representative and former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. While our union had a deeply contentious relationship with him, and his decisions had a profound impact on Houston firefighters, we also recognize his decades of public service to the city and the country. We offer our sincerest sympathies and prayers to everyone mourning his loss.”</i></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sylvester Turner carried Houston in his DNA with grit, courageous optimism, and the heart of a fighter.

Mayor Turner dedicated his life to serving the city of Houston and beyond, embodying resilience, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to equity,” said AAMA President and Montgomery, AL Mayor Steven L. Reed. “I have had the privilege of witnessing firsthand his tireless efforts to uplift marginalized communities and champion transformative change; he was my friend. His legacy will live on, both in the city and community that he spent his life’s work uplifting, and in our hearts. On behalf of the African American Mayors Association, we extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and the city of Houston. Let us honor his memory by continuing the work he so passionately believed in—building stronger, fairer cities and communities for all.”</i></p><p><i>“I had the privilege of being hired under his leadership as the first CEO of AAMA,” said Phyllis Dickerson, CEO of AAMA. “While attending a dinner last week at the Colombian Embassy, I was able to hug him for the last time. We will miss him dearly.”</i></p><p><b>Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick:</b></p><p><i>“This morning, Jan and I were saddened to hear the news of Congressman and former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner’s passing. Please join us in prayer for Congressman Turner’s family, friends, and the entire city of Houston.”</i></p><p><b>Congresswoman Lizzie Flecher:</b></p><p><i>“I join my fellow Houstonians, my colleagues in Congress, and people across our country in mourning the sudden loss of my friend and colleague, Congressman Sylvester Turner. I am heartbroken and devasted by the loss of this exceptional Houstonian and exceptional human being. He personified what it means to be a Houstonian—to believe in possibility, to work for it, and to share it with others. In his presence you could always feel the love for the city that we call home and for all the people who live here. We were lucky to have his service to our community for decades—including as a state representative, as Mayor, and as a member of Congress—as we were lucky to have his example to learn from and to inspire us. My heart goes out to his beloved family, his devoted staff, and all those who are grieving today.”</i></p><p><b>U.S. Senator John Cornyn:</b></p><p><i>“Sandy and I are saddened to hear of the passing of our friend, Representative Sylvester Turner,” said Sen. Cornyn. “Congressman Turner was a statesman who dedicated his life and career to serving the people of Texas, and although we had ideological differences, I was honored to work alongside him throughout his decades of public service on things like supporting law enforcement and survivors of abuse. I encourage Texans to join Sandy and me in praying for the entire Turner family during this time.”</i></p><p><b>Commissioner Dexter L. McCoy, Fort Bend County, Precinct 4:</b></p><p><i>“I am heartbroken to learn about the death of our community’s champion, Congressman Sylvester Turner. Houston’s forever Mayor, Congressman Turner showed up to work every day with the children of our region on his mind. He showed kids like me that we can achieve more than we could dream. If a black kid from Acres Homes could go on to be mayor of the fourth largest city in America and a member of Congress, so could we.</i></p><p><i>Today, many of us have also lost a mentor and friend. If you were a young black elected official in the Houston area, you inevitably came to know him as a mentor who always made himself available when you needed his guidance or support. When starting the African American Memorial Conservancy, I called Congressman Turner for guidance, as he had gone through the same process in forming the Emancipation Park Conservancy years ago. He gave great advice on how to get started and avoid some of the pitfalls he’d experienced. True to form, he didn’t hesitate when asked to join the advisory committee, even though he was about to step foot into congress himself.</i></p><p><i>His sage advice from decades of public service has helped guide me as I have started my career as an elected official just as I know it has guided countless other leaders in our community. Above all else that will be dearly missed. As I visited his office at the US Capitol this week, the sense of purpose was just as alive there as I knew it to be in every other office he occupied. To his daughter Ashley, his entire family, friends, staff, and all those who join me in feeling this loss, I express my deepest condolences. We must now be the light for others that he was for each of us.”</i></p><p><b>Congressman Wesley Hunt:</b></p><p><i>“Emily and I are heartbroken by the passing of Former Houston Mayor and United States Congressman Sylvester Turner. His life was a testament to resilience, dedication, and unwavering service.</i></p><p><i>Rising from humble beginnings, he never lost sight of where he came from or the people he served. His leadership shaped the city of Houston and touched the lives of millions,” </i><b>said Hunt.</b></p><p><i>“His passing is not just a loss for our city but a deeply personal one for me. Just last night, I had the privilege of speaking with him before the President’s address—never imagining it would be our last conversation.</i></p><p><i>Our hearts go out to the Turner family and all of Houston as we grieve the loss of a man who gave everything to his community. May his legacy continue to inspire us all.”</i></p><p><b>Senator Borris L. Miles on Congressman Sylvester Turner</b></p><p><i>“Congressman Sylvester Turner was a dedicated public servant who devoted over 37 years to the City of Houston, the State of Texas and the United States of America. During his time in the Texas House, he held various leadership positions and was known as a respected bipartisan leader. He played a key role in shaping fiscal policy and balancing multiple budgets, often using his trademark abacus. As mayor, he guided our city through numerous natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey and the COVID-19 pandemic. He championed pension reform, addressed illegal dumping, revitalized underserved neighborhoods and created the Hire Houston Youth program, which helped over 20,000 young adults secure jobs. As Congressman, he was an outspoken critic and always spoke on behalf the constituency of District 18.</i></p><p><i>“Sylvester Turner exemplified servant leadership and was a fierce advocate for the people, always remembering his roots and the communities he served. He was my friend, colleague, mentor and big brother. He played a significant role in shaping me into the legislator I am today. My heartfelt condolences go out to his daughter, Ashley, his family, and all who loved him.”</i></p><p><b>Representative Jolanda Jones: </b></p><p><i>“I am shocked and deeply saddened by this terrible news. The world has lost a warrior for justice, a hero for working people, and a true servant of God. Congressman Turner was a pillar of strength and resilience who dedicated his life to fighting for those who needed it most—especially the underserved and marginalized communities in Houston. His commitment to improving our city, uplifting working families, and advocating for justice will forever be a part of his remarkable legacy. I am praying for his family, for his constituents in the 18th, and for all Houstonians who will feel this loss deeply. Congressman Turner’s leadership and unwavering love for our city will be missed more than words can express. My heart is with all who mourn today.”</i></p><p><b>Houston City Controller Chris Hollins: </b></p><p><i>“I am deeply saddened by the passing of Sylvester Turner. He was more than a Congressman or Mayor, more than any political title could&nbsp;capture — he was a dear friend, a mentor, and a relentless champion for the people he served selflessly for over three decades. My heartfelt condolences go out to his daughter Ashley, his family, and his many friends.</i></p><p><i>When Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, Mayor Turner rose to the occasion, leading with unwavering strength and compassion. But his commitment didn’t end when the floodwaters receded — he worked tirelessly to rebuild our city, ensuring it was better prepared for future challenges. Before his tenure as mayor, he served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1989 to 2016. He was a fierce advocate for public education, expanded healthcare access, and stronger consumer protections — always prioritizing those in need.</i></p><p><i>Even in tumultuous times for our nation, he remained dedicated to serving the people of the 18th Congressional District with unmatched enthusiasm. In his final hours, he fought for what mattered most, speaking out about the importance of preserving healthcare access for Texas families. For years, I had the privilege of turning to Sylvester Turner for guidance — on issues both large and small. Like a true friend, he listened and offered earnest encouragement, all while leading and living by example. Now, it is incumbent upon all of us to carry forward the wisdom and spirit he so generously shared. I will miss him dearly and wish him a peaceful rest.”</i></p><p><b>Klein ISD: </b></p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG0wbqZxGNh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF;

He was 70 years old.</i></p><p><i>“I am deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Sylvester Turner,” said UH President Renu Khator. “He was a natural-born leader, humble servant and proud UH alum, who made a profound impact on our University, city and state. Most significantly, he never forgot his humble beginnings and used his platform to uplift and encourage young people to chase their dreams. He was a role model for our students, showing that no matter your zip code, race or income bracket, you can reach the highest heights. He will be sorely missed.”</i></p><p><i>Turner, who was born and raised in Houston, earned his bachelor’s degree in political science at UH in 1977. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Turner returned to Houston where he started his own law firm and occasionally lectured for the UH Law Center’s continuing legal education programs.</i></p><p><i>After more than two decades of service in the Texas House of Representatives, Turner was elected mayor of Houston in 2015 and served two terms, guiding the city through several challenges, including Hurricane Harvey and the COVID-19 pandemic. When his close friend and political ally U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee died last July, he successfully ran to replace her and was sworn into Congress in January.</i></p><p><i>Turner was a proud and vocal supporter of the University, recognizing its symbiotic relationship with the city. For his unwavering dedication and service, Turner received UH’s Distinguished Alumni Award, the Elected Public Official of the Year award and the Pioneer of Public Service Award. And in 2023, he was awarded the President’s Medallion, the University’s highest honor. The Sylvester Turner Academic Distinction Scholarship and the Sylvester Turner Scholarship Endowment Fund in the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences were established in his honor.</i></p><p><i>During a memorable commencement speech in 2018, Turner reminded CLASS graduates of the resilience and determination that define Cougar Pride.</i></p><p><i>“The road will not always be easy, sometimes it will be highly challenging. But Cougar Pride don’t turn back,” he said. “Live your life in such a way that when all is said and done, be able to say you have no regrets. Go Coogs – make your history as only you can.”</i></p><p><b>Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo: </b></p><p><i>We are deeply saddened by the passing of U.S. Congressman and former Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner.
