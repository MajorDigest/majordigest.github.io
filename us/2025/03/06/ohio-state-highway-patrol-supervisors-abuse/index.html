<p>(WKBN) -- Three men in supervisory positions with the Ohio State Highway Patrol were either reprimanded, demoted or recommended for termination after other staff members reported various acts of abuse.</p>



<p>What began as an investigation into one man resulted in repercussions for two additional men in positions of power as the investigative process progressed. While some instances are specific to one supervisor in particular, many of the situations overlap.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>NewsNation affiliate WKBN obtained the documents, which include testimonies and official notices, following a public records request to the Highway Patrol.</p>



<p>In an interview with one of the employees who reported mistreatment, the employee told the investigator they did not come forward earlier because all three men are "associated with each other" and they did not feel anything would get done.</p>



<p>However, after months of investigations and interviews, corrective actions were taken. </p>



<p><em>Please note the following reports are cumulative and redacted to protect the identities of the victims as well as to censor obscene content.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Termination recommended for lieutenant placed on paid administrative leave</h3>



<p>A lieutenant was recommended for termination after six employees with the Canfield post of the OSHP reported allegations against him. They were reported to the Office of Personnel in October 2024 but some of the employees detailed incidents going back several years.</p>



<p>An investigation was launched into Lt. Eric Brown after allegations of derogatory profanity directed at employees, disparaging remarks regarding women, inappropriate comments about employees' significant other, sexual misconduct, and inappropriate physical contact with employees.</p>



<p><strong>Abuse reported by subordinates against Brown</strong></p>



<p>A trooper told those investigating the complaints that Brown had at one point during an investigation shined a flashlight on the private parts of a passed-out woman who wasn't wearing underwear and that he would make breast gestures with his hands when arresting a woman. The trooper also reported Brown would make comments anytime he arrested an "attractive" woman.</p>



<p>Brown was also accused of smacking troopers on the head, with employees reporting to the investigator it happened between 15-20 times, claiming the open-handed hit was "hard enough to make [trooper] mad" and make his head go down after the strike. He was also accused of smacking troopers in the groin with the back of his hand.</p>


<div class="nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text">

</div>


<p>One trooper who reported Brown referred to him with a derogatory nickname said that, along with being smacked, it was "demoralizing" and made him lack confidence.</p>



<p>One of the troopers also reported that Brown said he did not want troopers working in the city of Youngstown, referring to the people there as "animals."</p>



<p>Another incident was reported of Brown pulling down a trooper's pants, including underwear, and exposing the trooper's bare backside. The trooper told investigators Brown was the only one laughing. </p>



<p>Another trooper reported Brown repeatedly made offensive and obscene comments about their significant other. </p>



<p>Troopers said Brown said there were things he could do to make their lives harder and continuously reminded them of what he could give or take away.</p>

<p>When one trooper was asked to word in a sentence why they did not come forward, the trooper said they were "scared to come forward and questioned who they would come forward to." When asked what the trooper was scared of, they replied they were scared of losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Another trooper said they took time to come forward because they did not want to be known as the trooper who told on their lieutenant and wanted to avoid a "bad rap" on their name.</p>



<p>The trooper said it wasn't just one of them coming forward, but all of them coming together to report it.</p>



<p><strong>Brown's interview with investigators</strong></p>



<p>During Brown's interview on Nov. 15, he told investigators he believed he had a great relationship with all of the employees at the post, stating he has an "open-door" policy.</p>



<p>"[Brown] has told the employees that if they have any issues with him, if he is doing something they do not like, if there is anything that can be done differently to make the workplace more enjoyable, or anything operationally, then they can come to sit and talk it over with him," he told the investigator, according to the document. </p>



<p>Brown told investigators he finds humor in many things and likes to joke with people and believes it helps put them at ease. He said he would never do anything that would be considered harassment, and if he knew somebody did not like something he did, then he would stop doing it.</p>



<p>When inspectors questioned Brown about the alleged sexual comments he made to coworkers and in reference to female arrestees, he said he did not recall making the comments.</p>



<p>"It could be, and it could not be. I don't know, without being there, you know, again, uh. Is that inappropriate? Yes, but you know what, there are comments these guys […], and like I said at the beginning of this meeting, you know if I'm guilty of anything, it is letting my guard and becoming one of them," Brown was quoted by investigators as saying. </p>



<p>Brown told investigators he did not remember the incident regarding the woman who did not have underwear on but clarified that he was not saying it did not happen, just that he didn't recall the specific incident.</p>



<p>Brown also said he did not remember the incident in which a trooper reported that Brown pulled their pants down, but admitted his memory is not good and said he believes the trooper who made the allegation is an honest person.</p>



<p>According to the investigative document, Brown clarified that he takes full responsibility for what he says and added that if he knew [the trooper] was offended by his comment, then he absolutely would not have said it. </p>



<p>When asked if Brown routinely makes jokes of a sexual nature, Brown said no. He said he knows his lieutenant role and has to hold himself to a higher standard.</p>



<p>"When I say it's retaliation, it is because I let my guard down. Did I say these things? Absolutely." Brown told investigators. </p>



<p>Brown questioned why no one ever brought these concerns to him, and recommended investigators speak to all members of the post, not just the six that spoke against him.</p>



<p>He said he is being made out to be some "monster" because it's retaliation. Brown added he owns what he said to [trooper name] and feels bad.</p>



<p>As for the allegations of physical violence where Brown is accused of hitting troopers, he said he "Would joke around with them, 'tap' them on the head and comment like 'get back to work.'"</p>



<p>Brown said he would not hit them with force or smack them. He said he was not just doing it to specific people or a shift and entirely denied doing it to use his position to intimidate others.</p>



<p>Brown said the act of tapping/hitting others is nothing, and "as crazy as it may sound, he believes it is a positive work environment."</p>



<p>In reference to hitting troopers in the groin, he said it is something they would do to each other, adding, "There is nothing assaultive or demeaning about it; they do it back and forth."</p>



<p>Brown also said absolutely none of the allegations had anything to do with race or gender. </p>



<p>He said he takes pride in the work he does, and he loves his people. He used the analogy of having kids, explaining sometimes you discipline them, you hold them accountable, and other times you joke with them.</p>



<p>He reiterated that there was nothing that was harassing or retaliatory. He said he loves the Three Stooges and said they smacked each other on the head; that is how he is.</p>



<p>Brown ultimately said it was disheartening to hear all the accusations and felt that he was being targeted.</p>



<p>Brown had been with OSHP since 1997 and was promoted to lieutenant in 2023.</p>



<p><strong>Investigative results into Brown</strong></p>



<p>Brown was immediately removed as the commander of the Canfield Post upon the Patrol's learning of the allegations and reassigned to the Warren District Headquarters throughout the investigation.</p>



<p>He was placed on administrative leave with pay effective in January 2025. </p>



<p>It was recommended by investigators that Brown be terminated on grounds of sexual harassment and discrimination and military courtesy and respect for rank. A lieutenant in the Ohio State Highway Patrol public affairs unit tells First News that Brown retired before he was served with discipline.</p>



<p>During the investigation into Brown, allegations arose against two other men in supervisor positions, detailed below.</p>



<p><em>First News has been unable to reach Brown for a response on the situation.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OSHP supervisor demoted for 'verbal abuse' of subordinates</h3>



<p>One Ohio State Highway Patrol employee was recently demoted after a letter from the Department of Public Safety stated he was verbally abusive to subordinates.</p>



<p>Jeffrey Greene was demoted from his position as Highway Patrol Captain to Highway Patrol Staff Lieutenant effective Feb. 12. As part of the demotion, Greene will be transferred<em> </em>from a local OSHP post to Cleveland District Headquarters. </p>



<p>The letter from Ohio Department of Public Safety Director Andrew Wilson to Greene stated the demotion was a result of an administrative investigation that found he "engaged in on-duty conduct which would bring discredit to the Division," stating Greene was verbally abusive toward subordinates.</p>



<p>The report says reasonable cause found that Greene violated the regulations of Conduct Unbecoming of an Officer and Military Courtesy and Respect for Rank. </p>



<p>Allegations against Greene reference certain incidents from the past as well as ongoing profane and derogatory language directed at subordinates.</p>



<p>In one instance, a trooper reported that Greene used profane language when insulting them during a training event when surrounded by approximately 30 other troopers. The trooper told investigators it embarrassed them in front of their peers.</p>



<p>During a capstone interview with superiors, a trooper alleges that Greene made a "very off-place comment about professionalism" and compared it to not committing a vulgar act. </p>



<p>According to a background investigation, a trooper reported that Greene made the following comment in 2018: “What are you looking at before I slap the s--t out of you." The report states Greene "allegedly attempted to apologize and referenced Middle-Eastern people," to which the involved trooper took offense.</p>



<p>"This is stuff I have kept in for a very long time. Again, ‘cause who am I going to say something to? The captain who that physically said he would slap the s--t out of me, or the lieutenant who actually done it," one of the troopers told the investigator.</p>



<p>Greene told investigators he does not recall threatening to slap the trooper. He said the allegations are very “pointed” and noted the allegation reportedly occurred seven years ago.</p>



<p>Greene said he is not "derogatory, challenging, or puts people down."</p>



<p>He said one thing people don't realize is that with elevation in rank comes alienation, adding that someone who was once a close coworker is no longer.</p>



<p>"Some of these things I remember, some I don't remember. So if that is the case, then I need to be better about the professionalism if these are founded," Greene said to investigators.</p>



<p>Greene admitted there is "enough of this" to make him realize his actions "were not reflective as a captain."</p>



<p>A letter addressed to Greene from Public Safety Director Andrew Wilson states that if Greene continues to violate work rules and procedures, further progressive discipline could lead to termination.</p>



<p>The demotion comes with a reduction in pay, according to the department record.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lt. issued a written reprimand for unbecoming conduct</h3>



<p>A lieutenant was also issued a written reprimand on Feb. 12 for conduct unbecoming an officer and the rules and regulations of Ohio State Highway Patrol. The captain investigating found the lieutenant "failed to perform his duties in a professional and courteous manner when interacting with a subordinate."</p>



<p>The lieutenant was listed as an immediate supervisor for some of the interviewees who reported abuse. While the lieutenant himself was not often portrayed as the primary aggressor, it was reported he was present during situations of unbecoming behavior, used profanity, and did not intervene in defense of others.</p>



<p>First News reached out to the Public Affairs Unit of OSHP asking to interview those involved in the investigation and was denied.</p>
