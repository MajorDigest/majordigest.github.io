<p>Pope Francis died Monday at age 88. The Vatican said the cause of death was a stroke that put him into a coma and led to heart failure.</p>


<p>History’s first Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated many conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.</p>


<p>Francis recently returned to the Vatican after 38 days in a hospital for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia, the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy. He last appeared in public on Sunday with an Easter blessing and popemobile tour through a cheering crowd in St. Peter’s Square. No funeral date has been announced. The next pope is yet to be decided.</p>


<p>“I hope that whoever comes after him can be as competent, as affectionate and as loving,” said Mary Soul, a Christian resident of Aleppo, Syria.</p>


<p>Here's the latest:</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A final call to Gaza's lone Catholic church</h3>


<p>Francis had a frequent evening ritual during the war in Gaza. He would call the territory's lone Catholic church to see how people huddled there were coping.</p>


<p>“He called us last time, it was Saturday, Holy Saturday, two days ago, and he asked us to pray and gave us a blessing and thanked us for all the service for peace,” said the Rev. Gabriele Romanielli at the church in Gaza City.</p>


<p>The pope in his last public appearance on Sunday again called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Only 1,000 Christians live in overwhelmingly Muslim Gaza. Some prayed for him on Monday.</p>


<p>“The pope was our biggest support after God in this war,” said 19-year-old Suheil Abu Dawoud.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vatican says the cause of death was a stroke</h3>


<p>The Vatican said the cause of Francis’ death was a stroke that put him into a coma and led to heart failure.</p>


<p>It also said the pope had decreed that he will be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica in a simple underground tomb. The basilica is home to Francis’ favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom he was particularly devoted.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vatican holds its first public commemoration</h3>


<p>The Vatican has begun a Rosary prayer in St. Peter’s Square in its first public commemoration following Pope Francis’ death. Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, led the prayer as the sun set.</p>


<p>The first reading was delivered by Sister Raffaella Petrini, president of the Vatican City State and one of the highest ranking women at the Vatican. Her appointment was a sign of Francis' insistence that women be given more prominent, decision-making roles.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">South Sudan recalls ‘a profound act of humility’</h3>


<p>The South Sudan Council of Churches says it remembers with gratitude Francis’ visit to the country and his “dedicated efforts to promote healing and unity among our leaders.” The pope once famously knelt and kissed the feet of rivals President Salva Kiir and deputy Riek Machar, which the council called “a profound act of humility.” Tensions continue, however, recently raising fears of a return to civil war.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Putin says the timing of the death was ‘a special sign’</h3>


<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin in televised remarks noted that the pope died immediately after Easter, suggesting that “this is a special sign that the person has lived their life not in vain and has done a lot of good.” Putin said Russians will always remember his “highly positive attitude to Russia.” Earlier, he said the pope encouraged the development of a dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘We are a bit orphaned’</h3>


<p>The archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Ignacio Garcia Cuerva, has told journaists that “we are a bit orphaned.” He also said the Argentine Francis was famous for asking people to pray for him. “Then he would say, ‘And if you don’t have faith? Still, send good vibes my way.’”</p>


<p>The archbishop said it couldn’t have been easy for Francis to learn to be a “father to the world.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pope’s historic address to Congress, a first</h3>


<p>Francis became the first pope to address the U.S. Congress. It was a pivotal moment in bitterly divided Washington in 2015. He called on lawmakers to create a “culture of care” in welcoming immigrants, protecting the environment and sharing the nation’s wealth with those less fortunate.</p>


<p>The pope later spoke from a Capitol balcony, greeting thousands with “buenos dias.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Love from beyond the Catholic faith</h3>


<p>“I spoke this morning to my newsagent who told me his mother, who is a Hindu, loved Pope Francis,” said Patrick Somerville, as mourners knelt before a portrait of Francis at London’s Westminster Cathedral to offer prayers. “And I think that says it all.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘I think he was a rebel’</h3>


<p>In Francis’ hometown of Buenos Aires, Argentines gathered for Mass. Some cried. “I think he was a rebel. He may have been contradictory, but that was nice, too,” said worshiper Catalina Favaro.</p>


<p>Bishop Jorge García Cuerva told those gathered that “the pope of everyone has died. The pope of all humanity who insisted one and a thousand times that there must be room for everyone.”</p>


<p>The pope’s beloved soccer team — Buenos Aires club San Lorenzo, who nickname is “The Saints” — wrote “Goodbye, Holy Father” on its website. The team won the national championship in 2013, the year Francis was elected pope.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biden and the Obamas remember</h3>


<p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden says Francis was “unlike any who came before him. Pope Francis will be remembered as one of the most consequential leaders of our time, and I am better for having known him.” Biden, who is Catholic, called the pope a “challenging teacher” and “above all, he was a pope for everyone.”</p>


<p>Biden had planned to visit Francis one more time before leaving office, but the trip was canceled because of wildfires in the Los Angeles area.</p>


<p>“Pope Francis was the rare leader who made us want to be better people,” former U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, said. “He shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mixed emotions in Ukraine</h3>


<p>In Ukraine, there was a mix of sorrow and hope. “From a human point of view, it’s sad, of course,” said Valentina Sofilkanych in Lviv. “But as a Ukrainian, I hope the next Pope will be more pro-Ukrainian, we will feel more support from the church.” Francis tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality during the war there.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some saw meaning in the small details</h3>


<p>“He was a pope who was humble. When he visited Kenya, he rode in a very simple car,” said Ted Mutuku, a Catholic in the capital, Nairobi.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Voices from the Middle East</h3>


<p>The leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said Francis was always deeply interested in the region, and Gaza was “a symbol of Francis’ pontificate,” with the pope “always close to the poor, against the war.”</p>


<p>The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem will hold a requiem mass on Wednesday with leaders of other major Christian sects.</p>


<p>In the occupied West Bank, Bethlehem Mayor Anton Salman said Francis worked to “restore the value and meaning of humanity.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘The world’s conscience'</h3>


<p>The pope was “in many respects the world’s conscience, never hesitating to challenge the powerful on behalf of the vulnerable,” said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is Catholic. He noted the pope’s visit in 2022, when he apologized for the church’s cooperation with Canada’s policy of Indigenous residential schools, saying the forced assimilation destroyed their cultures.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‘Love where there was hatred’</h3>


<p>Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the pope “tirelessly sought to bring love where there was hatred. Unity where there was discord. And the understanding that we are all equal, living in the same house, our planet, which urgently needs our care.” Francis visited in 2013.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The soccer-loving pope</h3>


<p>Gianni Infantino, president of soccer’s world governing body FIFA, noted the pope’s love for soccer and said that “all the prayers of the whole football world are with him.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A final appearance, a final goodbye</h3>


<p>Italian President Sergio Mattarella said Pope Francis’ final public act – an Easter morning blessing and popemobile tour through a crowd of thousands in St. Peter’s Square – in retrospect seems like his final goodbye to the church.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Criticism over sexual abuse issue</h3>


<p>Critics of the Catholic Church’s handing of clergy sex abuse say the pope did far from enough.</p>


<p>“Where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the U.S.-based group BishopAccountability.</p>


<p>David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, noted the pope’s “prompt and impressive action” on other matters but said the pope’s “genial personality and warm demeanor distracted many from the unhealthy and still essentially unaddressed structural and cultural flaws in the church that cause kids to keep being hurt.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">As Catholic Church grows in Africa, many mourn</h3>


<p>Many across Africa have said they felt connected with the pope, who often spoke about issues at the heart of the region, from climate change to marginalization.</p>


<p>The pope was “very unambiguous in telling world powers to stop exploiting Africans,” said the Rev. Michael Nsikak Umoh, spokesperson for the Nigerian bishops’ association.</p>


<p>In Congo, where pope visited in 2023 to demand that foreign powers stop plundering Africa’s natural resources, Abbé Camille Esika in the capital, Kinshasa, said Francis “wanted to be the voice of the voiceless.”</p>


<p>The pope visited Africa five times, acknowledging the strong growth of the Catholic Church there. The South African Catholic Bishops’ Conference has encouraged all Catholics to pray for those choosing his successor.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">U.N. chief praises the pope's example of ‘mutual understanding’</h3>


<p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement recalls that Pope Francis once said: “The future of humankind isn’t exclusively in the hands of politicians, of great leaders, of big companies … (it) is, most of all, in the hands of those people who recognize the other as a ‘you’ and themselves as part of an ‘us.’”</p>


<p>Guterres adds that “Our divided and discordant world will be a much better place if we follow his example of unity and mutual understanding in our own actions.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public likely can start paying final respects on Wednesday</h3>


<p>The Vatican says the general public likely can begin paying final respects to Pope Francis starting Wednesday in St. Peter’s Basilica. The date will be confirmed when cardinals gather for the first time after Francis’ death Tuesday morning.</p>


<p>Francis’ coffin will be moved from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where he lived to St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing. In a change ordered by Francis, the pope’s body will no longer placed on an elevated bier in the basilica. Rather, the wooden coffin will be placed facing the pews.</p>


<p>No date for the funeral has been announced. It must be held between four and six days after the death.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vance's team was ‘excited’ over meeting with the pope</h3>


<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Vance’s team expressed “how excited and grateful they were for the opportunity to have met with the pope just yesterday.” In an appearance on Fox News, she added that "it’s a solemn day for Catholics around the world, and we are praying for all those who loved the pope and believed in him.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trump offers condolences</h3>


<p>President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dalai Lama says Francis lived a simple but meaningful life</h3>


<p>The Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama offered prayers, saying Francis dedicated himself to the service of others, “consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life. The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warmhearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Orthodox Christian leader says Francis wished for a greater unity of churches</h3>


<p>Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, the leader of the Orthodox Christians, said Francis’ wish was for a greater unity with the Orthodox, calling him "a genuine friend of Orthodox Christianity.”</p>


<p>He mentioned their meeting in 2014, in which Bartholomew told Francis of the upcoming 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council and invited him, saying Francis “appeared enthusiastic.” But “it was not to be,” Bartholomew said, adding that he would welcome Francis’ successor.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Iran’s president commends Francis’ position on the war in Gaza</h3>


<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian offered condolences and praised Francis' humanitarian stance including support for “innocent Palestinian women and children” in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Irish leader says Francis recognized every human’s essential dignity</h3>


<p>Irish President Michael Higgins says Francis’ recognition of the “essential dignity” of every human being helped him confront issues such as climate change and the plight of migrants, as well as the child sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church. During his last visit in 2018, Francis spoke about the scandal that has undermined support for the church in the once overwhelmingly Catholic country.</p>


<p>“On such matters, and on others such as attitudes towards women and those of the LGBTQ+ community within the Church, Pope Francis sought to play a positive role,” Higgins said. “I recall at the end of our meetings he would say as to his work on such issues, ‘it is very difficult’, as he asked for and offered prayers.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Head of World Jewish Congress calls Francis a true moral leader</h3>


<p>The president of the World Jewish Congress, Ronald S. Lauder, described Francis as “a true moral leader, a man of deep faith and humanity, and a steadfast friend to the Jewish people.”</p>


<p>Lauder noted that in 2022, the congress' executive committee had a private audience with the pope "where we launched the historic ‘Kishreinu’ (Our Bond) initiative, marking a new chapter in Catholic-Jewish relations and reinforcing the common future of our two peoples.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Churches in the Philippines ring bells to mourn Francis</h3>


<p>Churches in the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia, rang their bells to mourn Francis. He visited in 2015 to console survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and celebrate Mass before millions in Manila.</p>


<p>“Pope Francis showed us what it means to suffer with others and find hope in the midst of pain,” Manila Archbishop Jose Advincula said. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said "his humility brought many back to the fold of the church.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mother of a slain Israeli-American hostage praises Francis</h3>


<p>The mother of a slain American-Israeli hostage praised Francis’ advocacy for Hamas-held captives in Gaza.</p>


<p>Rachel Goldberg-Polin was among families who met with the pope in 2023. She said he “felt our sorrow and suffering, and we so appreciated his advocacy on this topic, and on trying to find peace and reconciliation.” Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five others were killed by their captors last year as Israeli troops closed in.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First formal Vatican service for Francis set for Monday evening</h3>


<p>The first formal liturgical ritual for Francis will occur at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Monday with the confirmation of the pope’s death and the placement of the body in the coffin.</p>

<p>According to the new rites and rituals Francis approved last year, the body will remain in the chapel for a few days before being brought for public viewing in St. Peter’s Basilica.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Canonization of the first millennial saint postponed</h3>


<p>The canonization of the first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, has been postponed, the Vatican announced. It had been planned for Sunday. Acutis, an Italian teen, died of acute leukemia at age 15 in 2006.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Flags lowered in Italy</h3>


<p>Flags flew at half-staff in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Italy. The faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square, where bells tolled.</p>


<p>Eva Bonnano, from Philadelphia, called it “a very sad day. It is honestly impressive, I think, that he made it to Easter, I think that is almost like a miracle for Italy.”</p>


<p>Johann Xavier said he had traveled from Australia, hoping to see the pope. “But then we heard about it when we came in here. It pretty much devastated all of us."</p>

<p>“I remember, in the brief times I spent with him, how this holy man of God was also very human,” the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, said in a statement. “He was witty, lively, good to be with, and the warmth of his personality and interest in others shone out from him.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Criticism from the Women’s Ordination Conference</h3>


<p>The Women’s Ordination Conference had been frustrated by Francis’ unwillingness to push for the ordination of women, calling it “painfully incongruous with his otherwise pastoral nature.”</p>


<p>It added that “this made him a complicated, frustrating, and sometimes heart-breaking figure for many women.” It had long prayed that Francis would be transformed by the testimonies of women sharing their sincere calls from God to ordained ministry, but "when it came to the topic of women in ministry, he seemed stuck in bad theology and outdated tropes.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">India mourns Francis as a beacon of compassion</h3>


<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose country has nearly 30 million Christians making up 2.3% of the population, said Pope Francis will always be remembered “as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage."</p>


<p>Modi said he was greatly inspired by the pope's commitment to inclusive development," adding: “For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Meloni says ‘we say goodbye to a great shepherd’</h3>


<p>Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said the news “deeply saddens us, as we are saying goodbye to a great man and a great shepherd. I had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, his counsel and his teachings, which never failed me, not even in times of trial and suffering.’‘</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Macron says Francis gave hope to the poor</h3>


<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is largely Catholic, shared his condolences on social media: “From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the Church to bring joy and hope to the poorest. For it to unite humans among themselves, and with nature. May this hope forever outlast him.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dutch prime minister says the pope was a man of the people</h3>


<p>Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the pope “was in every way a man of the people," adding that he "recognized the burning issues of our day and called attention to them. With his sober way of life, acts of service and compassion, Pope Francis was a role model for many – Catholics and non-Catholics alike."</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel’s president offers condolences to Christians</h3>


<p>Israel’s mostly ceremonial president offered condolences to Christians, calling Pope Francis a man of “deep faith and boundless compassion.” Isaac Herzog said the pope fostered strong ties with Jews and advanced interfaith dialogue.</p>


<p>Francis repeatedly criticized Israel’s wartime conduct and said allegations of genocide, which Israel has adamantly denied, should be investigated.</p>


<p>“I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered,” Herzog wrote on social media.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Top EU leader says Francis was an inspiration for the world</h3>


<p>Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, remembered Francis as an inspiration for the entire world, not just Christians: “He inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Francis made last public appearance on Easter Sunday</h3>


<p>Francis made his last public appearance on Easter Sunday, when he emerged to bless thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square and treat them to a surprise popemobile romp through the piazza, drawing wild cheers and applause. Before that, he met briefly with U.S. Vice President JD Vance.</p>


<p>He performed the blessing from the same loggia where he was introduced to the world on March 13, 2013, as the 266th pope.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pope died at 7:35 a.m. Monday</h3>


<p>Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Vatican camerlengo, announced that Francis died at 7:35 a.m. Monday (05:35 GMT). </p>


<p>“The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,″ Farrell said.</p>


<p>“He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with faithfulness, courage, and universal love, especially for the poorest and most marginalized.</p>


<p>“With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite, merciful love of God, One and Tribune.″</p>
