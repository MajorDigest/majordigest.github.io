<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amazon’s Prime ‘Big Deal Days’ are in full swing</h3>



<p>Amazon’s&nbsp;yearly October Prime Day, otherwise known as&nbsp;“Big Deal Days,”&nbsp;kicked off yesterday, and the deals have been worth shopping. But the sales event ends today, and so does&nbsp;access to deals across pretty much every category on Amazon, from electronics to home goods, toys, kitchen, fashion and more. With prices higher this year, this is a great time to get a head start on holiday gift shopping, but keep in mind: You’ll need a Prime membership&nbsp;to take advantage of all of the&nbsp;deals.</p>
