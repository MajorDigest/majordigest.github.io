<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Using filters to find deals under $100</h3>



<p>We’ve covered some of the best Prime Day deals under $100, but how do you find your own discounted goods on Amazon? Luckily, it’s simple to use filters to find deals under $100. First, search for the item or navigate to the category you want to search within. Once you have a page of Amazon search results, you can move on to using filters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The filters are found to the left of your screen if you’re using a computer or by pressing the “filters” tab if you’re navigating Amazon on your phone or tablet. Scroll to the “price” filter. You’ll find some prepopulated price ranges to search, plus a minimum and maximum box for you to enter your own price range. If you want to see all deals under $100, enter $100 in the maximum box and leave the minimum box black. Hit the “go” button, and your search results will be filtered so that you only see those under $100.</p>
