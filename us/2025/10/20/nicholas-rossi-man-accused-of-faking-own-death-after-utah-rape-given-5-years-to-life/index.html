<p>SALT LAKE COUNTY, Utah (KTVX) – Nicholas Rossi, the man who was extradited from Scotland to Utah to face 2008 rape allegations, has been sentenced in Salt Lake County to five years to life in prison.</p>



<p>“While justice may have been slow, the defendant was convicted and now sentenced to prison, consistent with the harm he caused to our survivor. She can rest assured he did not escape punishment,” said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. “We thank our prosecutors, Brandon Simmons and Clint Heiner, as well as our victim advocate Cami Heng, for their years of dedication to this case and helping deliver justice for the survivor in this case. We appreciate the work of both our local, national, and international partners that worked together to ensure the defendant could be held accountable for his actions."</p>



<p>Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, is accused of faking his death to escape rape charges in Salt Lake County and Utah County. Rossi insisted that prosecutors had the wrong man, and that he was actually a man named Arthur Knight.</p>



<p>Rossi’s Salt Lake County trial, which focused on the rape of a 24-year-old woman in Dec. 2008, began on Aug. 11. The trial ended just two days later, on Aug. 13, when a jury found him guilty of first-degree felony rape.</p>



<p>He has now been sentenced to five years to life at the Utah State Correctional Facility for this crime.</p>



<p>After being found guilty of rape in Salt Lake County, on Sept. 24, Rossi was found guilty of rape for a second time in Utah County. His sentencing in that case is scheduled for Nov. 4.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h3>



<p>Court documents state that in Dec. 2008, Rossi trapped the 24-year-old woman in his bedroom, not allowing her to leave, and committed the assault.</p>



<p>Rossi had met the victim online in 2008, and they dated between Nov. and Dec. of that year. During the trial, the victim, now 41, testified that while they were dating, Rossi constantly borrowed money from her and pressured her to marry him.</p>



<p>According to a press release from the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office, Rossi bought them wedding rings. He also became verbally abusive. After an argument while they were at the Gateway mall in Salt Lake City, the victim took off her wedding ring and got into her car.</p>



<p>Rossi then began screaming and hitting the car, but eventually, he got into the car, and the victim drove him home. At his home, he refused to get out of the car and said that he would call the police and say that she hit him, the release stated.</p>



<p>The victim testified that he eventually convinced her to come inside his home, where she attempted to end the relationship. He trapped her in the bedroom and then raped her, according to the document.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to the survivor in this case for her willingness to come forward, years after this attack took place. We appreciate her patience as we worked to bring the defendant back to Salt Lake County so that this trial could take place and she could get justice. It took courage and bravery to take the stand and confront her attacker to hold him accountable,” Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Faking his death</h3>



<p>In 2020, Rossi reportedly told a media outlet that he had late-stage cancer and an obituary was later published online, according to the Associated Press. The obituary claimed he died on Feb. 29, 2020, but he was later arrested for an unrelated incident in Glasgow while he was being treated for COVID-19.</p>



<p>Following that arrest, he was recognized as a fugitive and extradited from Scotland to the U.S. in 2023.</p>



<p>In addition to the Utah charges, Rossi also faces charges related to alleged sexual assault, harassment, and possible kidnapping in Rhode Island, Ohio, and Massachusetts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Victim statement</h3>



<p>The victim, 41, now happily married with three dogs, said she was 24 when the alleged rape took place. She was reportedly living with her parents at the time and working at a credit union.</p>



<p>After recovering from a car accident that left her hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury, she met Rossi online, through his post in the personal section of Craigslist.</p>



<p>She said she was going to be alone for her birthday that year, so they decided to meet up. They spent the first date hanging out at Rossi’s apartment in Orem.</p>



<p>“He was very charming and seemed very interested in school and politics and music. He was very nice to me,” she said.</p>



<p>They would go out a few times a week. She said they spent a lot of time at the Apple Store because Rossi liked their products. At one point, he was going to get evicted from his apartment and she gave him $1,000. She said it made up almost all her savings at the time.</p>



<p>“He was constantly borrowing money from me,” she said.</p>



<p>She spent another $2,000 on engagement rings, which she said was Rossi’s idea. Things went downhill quickly, she said.</p>



<p>“He started to become very controlling and dictated how I dressed,” she said.</p>



<p>One night at the Gateway Mall, Rossi allegedly said something to her that caused a fight.</p>



<p>“That was the first time I had ever seen such rage in his eyes,” she said. “I was just sitting in the car hoping he’d stop so that I could leave.”</p>



<p>It was that night when Rossi raped her in his bedroom. She said she was petrified, unsure of what else he was capable of.</p>



<p>After she left, she decided she could never see him again in person and changed her phone number to cut off contact. They would stop all communication shortly after.</p>
