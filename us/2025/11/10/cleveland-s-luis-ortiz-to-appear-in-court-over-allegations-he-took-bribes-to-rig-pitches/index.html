<p>BOSTON (AP) — Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz appeared in federal court Monday on charges accusing him and teammate Emmanuel Clase of taking bribes to help associates in their native Dominican Republic win prop bets placed on pitches they threw.</p>


<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell in Boston granted Ortiz his release but with several conditions, including that he surrender his passport, restrict his travel to the Northeast and post a $500,000 bond, $50,000 of it secured. He also was ordered to avoid contact with anyone who could be viewed as a victim, witness or co-defendant in the case.</p>


<p>Ortiz, dressed in a pale green track suit, did not say anything in court. His lawyers declined to speak to reporters afterward.</p>


<p>Shortly after the brief hearing, Major League Baseball announced new limits on betting on individual pitches, saying its authorized gaming operators will cap wagers on them at $200 and exclude them from parlays.</p>


<p>According to the indictment against the Ortiz and Clase unsealed Sunday, they took several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two unnamed gamblers in their home country win at least $460,000 on bets placed on the speed and outcome of certain pitches, including some that landed in the dirt.</p>


<p>Clase, who was the Guardians’ closer, and Ortiz, a starter, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July, when MLB started investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when the two pitched. Some of the games in question were in April, May and June.</p>


<p>Ortiz, 26, was arrested Sunday by the FBI at Boston Logan International Airport. Clase, 27, is believed to be outside the U.S., according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the case and did so on condition of anonymity.</p>


<p>Ortiz and Clase “betrayed America’s pastime,” U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said Sunday. “Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.”</p>


<p>Ortiz’s lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement Sunday that his client is innocent and “has never, and would never, improperly influence a game — not for anyone and not for anything.”</p>


<p>Georgalis said Ortiz’s defense team previously documented for prosecutors that the payments and money transfers between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for legal activities.</p>


<p>MLB said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity and has fully cooperated with authorities. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,” the league said in a statement.</p>


<p>In a statement, the Guardians said: “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action. We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.”</p>


<p>Clase and Ortiz are each charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison.</p>


<p>In one example cited in the indictment, Clase allegedly invited a bettor to a game against the Boston Red Sox in April and spoke with him by phone just before taking the mound. Four minutes later, the indictment said, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph (157.63 kph).</p>


<p>Clase, a three-time All-Star and two-time American League Reliever of the Year, had a $4.5 million salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. The three-time AL save leader began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t ask for payoffs until this year, prosecutors said.</p>


<p>Prosecutors said Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary this year, got in on the scheme in June and is accused of rigging pitches in games against the Seattle Mariners and the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>


<p>The charges are the latest bombshell developments in a federal crackdown on betting in professional sports. </p>


<p>Last month, more than 30 people, including prominent basketball figures such as Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, were arrested in a gambling sweep that rocked the NBA.</p>
