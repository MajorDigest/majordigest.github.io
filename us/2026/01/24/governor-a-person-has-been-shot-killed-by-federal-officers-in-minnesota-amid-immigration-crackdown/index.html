    <p>A federal immigration officer fatally shot a man in Minneapolis on Saturday, drawing hundreds of protesters onto the frigidly cold streets in a city already shaken by another fatal shooting weeks earlier.</p><p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a 37-year-old man was killed but declined to identify him. He added that information about what led up to the shooting was limited. The man was identified by his parents as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse. The officer who shot Pretti is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.</p><p>The Minnesota National Guard has been activated by Gov. Tim Walz and is assisting local police amid growing protests. Guard troops are going to both to the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.</p><p>There have been daily protests in the Twin Cities since the Jan. 7 shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who fired into her vehicle. Pretti was killed just over a mile away from where Good was shot.</p><p>The Latest: </p><p>Democratic senators come out against funding DHS, raising risk of another shutdown</p><p>Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said Saturday that she too would not vote for legislation in the Senate that would fund the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>In doing so, Cortez Masto joined fellow Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen. The two moderates broke with their party last year on a vote over the last government shutdown.</p><p>Others like Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii have said in the wake of the shooting that they would oppose a DHS funding bill that is part of a spending package in the Senate that aims to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month.</p><p>Minnesota-born Defense Secretary Hegseth says ICE is greater than Minnesota</p><p>Pete Hegseth posted on the social platform X to thank God for the “patriots” who work for ICE and said, “we have your back 100%.”</p><p>The Pentagon chief added: “Shame on the leadership of Minnesota — and the lunatics in the street. ICE MN.”</p><p>Hegseth was born and raised in Minnesota.</p><p>Nevada Sen. Rosen says she will vote against any government funding package that funds ICE</p><p>Sen. Jacky Rosen, a moderate Democrat from a political swing state, made the announcement Saturday after the fatal shooting in Minneapolis. Rosen was one of eight Democratic senators last year to break ranks with her party and vote with Republicans to move to reopen the government.</p><p>“The abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,” Rosen said via the social platform X.</p><p>“Enough is enough. We need to rein in ICE’s out of control conduct,” Rosen said.</p><p>A bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security is part of a package of spending bills that is moving through the Senate to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month.</p><p>Top Democrat on House Homeland Security Committee calls for Noem impeachment</p><p>Congressman Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be impeached and denounced statements from the administration about the man DHS agents killed. </p><p>“Apparently, the Trump administration and its secret police only support the First and Second Amendments when it’s convenient to them,” Thompson said in a statement.</p><p>Thompson called on Demorats in the U.S. Senate to vote against a funding bill for DHS that passed the lower chamber last week.“This is un-American and has to stop,” Thompson said. “The House must immediately take steps to impeach Kristi Noem.”</p><p>Walz excoriates immigration operations in Minnesota</p><p>Walz issued a statement Saturday calling immigration enforcement “organized brutality.”</p><p>“The federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. It is a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed yet another life," Walz said. </p><p>He said the state, and not the federal government, will lead the investigation into the death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti.</p><p>Pretti was shot and killed by federal officers amid an immigration operation.</p><p>“Minnesotans and our local law enforcement have done everything we can to deescalate. The federal government must deescalate. I once again call on the President to remove the 3,000 agents from Minnesota who are sowing chaos and violence."</p><p>Congressional Democrats sharply criticize DHS chief Kristi Noem </p><p>Congressional Democrats responded with immediate outrage to the killing of another person by federal agents in Minneapolis. </p><p>Congressman Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, called for ICE to be “abolished” and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be impeached.</p><p>“Trump has created a militarized police force accountable only to him and ready to murder people in our streets. These agents need to leave our cities NOW,” the California Democrat wrote on social media. </p><p>Congressman Brad Schneider, chair of the moderate New Democratic Coalition in the U.S. House, called for an investigation into the shooting and for federal agents to leave Minnesota.</p><p>“Every agent involved in this shooting must be suspended pending a full and independent investigation and ultimately held to account for their actions today,” Schneider said in a statement. “And, Kristi Noem has got to go. She needs to resign or be fired. If not, Congress must act,” the Illinois Democrat continued.</p><p>Man identified who was shot and killed amid Minneapolis immigration operation</p><p>The man who was shot and killed by a federal officer during an immigration operation has been identified as 37-year-old Alex Pretti. His parents told The Associated Press that Pretti was an intensive care unit nurse.</p><p>Vance criticizes local authorities for refusing to cooperate with ICE agents</p><p>Vice President JD Vance responded to the shooting in a post on X and said that when he visited Minneapolis this week, “what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand.”</p><p>He accused local officials in Minnesota of ignoring requests from ICE agents to work with them.</p><p>Notably, federal officials refused to cooperate with local officials on an investigation into the shooting death of Renee Good on Jan. 7.</p><p>Store owner opens to help protesters amid freezing temperatures</p><p>Allison Bross opened her fashion store, b. Resale, next to the shooting scene for the protesters to grab food, water, use the restroom, receive medical attention and get a warm break from the frigid temperatures outside.</p><p>“We’re a community-based business, we don’t exist without the community,” she said. “So if we hear someone in our neighborhood is getting hurt, I’m going to be here immediately.” </p><p>Meanwhile, a makeshift memorial at a bus stop next to the site of the shooting was taking shape. People left flowers and lit candles.</p><p>Hennepin County Sheriff's Office asks for National Guard help</p><p>Sheriff Dawanna Witt has requested assistance from the Minnesota National Guard to support deputies at the Whipple Federal Building so that deputies can be assigned to other areas.</p><p>The Minnesota National Guard’s role is to work in support of local law enforcement and emergency responders, providing additional resources, the sheriff's office said. </p><p>Their presence is meant to help create a secure environment where all Minnesotans can exercise their rights safely, including the right to peacefully protest.</p><p>“We know this moment is challenging for our community. Remember that our local teams are also part of this community. We respect and protect everyone’s rights to voice concerns and stand up for what they believe in, but we urge all actions to remain peaceful and lawful. Our collective priority remains protecting our neighborhoods and keeping people safe,” a statement said.</p><p>Trump weighs in on the shooting in Minneapolis</p><p>Trump posted to his Truth Social account after a man was killed by federal officers during an immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis. Trump's statement said:</p><p>“This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do! Why does Ilhan Omar have $34 Million Dollars in her account? And where are the Tens of Billions of Dollars that have been stolen from the once Great State of Minnesota? We are there because of massive Monetary Fraud, with Billions of Dollars missing, and Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State through the Democrats’ Open Border Policy. We want the money back, and we want it back, NOW. Those Fraudsters who stole the money are going to jail, where they belong! This is no different than a really big Bank Robbery. Much of what you’re witnessing is a COVER UP for this Theft and Fraud. </p><p>"The Mayor and the Governor are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric! Instead, these sanctimonious political fools should be looking for the Billions of Dollars that has been stolen from the people of Minnesota, and the United States of America. LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB! 12,000 Illegal Alien Criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota. If they were still there, you would see something far worse than you are witnessing today!””</p><p>DHS says officers fired “defensive shots”</p><p>Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>She said officers fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him. O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”</p><p>Police chief says man shot and killed was a ‘lawful gun owner’</p><p>O’Hara said the man’s only previous interaction with law enforcement as far as he knew was for traffic tickets.</p><p>"And we believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry,” he said.</p><p>Police chief asks public, law enforcement to remain calm</p><p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement, following the shooting of a man. </p><p>“Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,” the chief said. </p><p>“We urge everyone to remain peaceful. We recognize that there is a lot of anger and a lot of questions around what has happened, but we need people to remain peaceful in the area.”</p><p>Police also clarified that the age of the man shot is 37.</p><p>Angry crowd gathers after shooting of man in Minneapolis </p><p>An angry crowd gathered after the shooting and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home. </p><p>One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car.</p><p>The intersection where the shooting has been blocked off, and Border Patrol agents are on the scene wielding batons.</p><p>The shooting happened a day after thousands of demonstrators protesting the crackdown on immigrants crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave. </p><p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar expresses outrage at shooting</p><p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has expressed outrage at the shooting of a man during an immigration operation.</p><p>“Donald Trump and all your lieutenants who ordered this ICE surge: watch the horrific video of the killing today. The world is watching. Thousands of citizens stopped and harassed. Local police no longer able to do their work. Kids hiding. Schools closed. Get ICE out of Minnesota,” Klobuchar said in a message posted on X.</p><p>Minneapolis Democrats react to the shooting</p><p>Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith issued a statement after the shooting of a man during an ICE operation. She said, “We are gathering more information, but ICE must leave now so MPD can secure the scene and do their jobs.”</p><p>Rep. Angie Craig said in a statement that she has seen “my own eyes the video of another horrific killing by ICE agents this morning in Minneapolis. This is sickening.</p><p>“The agency is beyond out of control. How much more evidence do my Republican colleagues in Minnesota need to speak out?”</p><p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara calls for calm</p><p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara called for protesters who amassed at the scene of a shooting to stay calm and leave the area. “Please do not destroy our own city,” he said at a press conference.</p><p>Rep. Omar releases statement after Minnesota shooting</p><p>Rep. Ilhan Omar issued a statement after the shooting of a man by federal officers in Minnesota.</p><p>“I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community. It is beyond shameful these federal agents are targeting our residents instead of protecting them,” she said in a statement.</p><p>“This isn’t isolated or accidental. The Trump administration is trying to beat us into submission rather than protect us. ...This administration cannot continue violating constitutional rights under the guise of immigration enforcement.” </p>
