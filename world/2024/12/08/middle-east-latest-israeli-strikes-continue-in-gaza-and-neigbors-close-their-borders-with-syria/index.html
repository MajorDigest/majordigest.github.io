<p>Syrian opposition fighters say they have entered Damascus following a stunning advance across the country as the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor reported that President Bashar Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location. </p>


<p>Rami Abdurrahman said Assad took a flight from Damascus and left early Sunday. There was no immediate official statement from the Syrian government. '</p>


<p>It was the first time opposition forces had reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege.</p>


<p>The night before, opposition forces had taken the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as government forces abandoned it. Homs is an important intersection between Damascus and Syria’s coastal provinces that are the Syrian leader’s base of support. </p>


<p>The rapidly developing events have shaken the region. Lebanon said it was closing all its land border crossings with Syria except for one that links Beirut with Damascus. Jordan closed a border crossing with Syria, too.</p>


<p>Eight key countries gathered with the U.N. special envoy on Syria on the sidelines of the Doha Summit for two hours of discussions Saturday night, and more will follow. The U.N. envoy seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an “orderly political transition.”</p>


<p>___</p>


<p>Here's the Latest:</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Military command of Syria's opposition says Damascus is ‘free' of Bashar Assad’s rule</h3>


<p>BEIRUT - The military command of the Syrian opposition says its fighters have entered the capital Damascus claiming that it is “free" of President Bashar Assad’s rule.</p>


<p>The so-called Military Command Administration said Assad had fled without giving further details.</p>


<p>Assad’s departure marks the end of the 54-year of Assad family rule of Syria with an iron fist. His father Hafez Assad came to power in a bloodless coup in 1970 and ruled until his death in 2000. Bashar Assad was elected weeks after his father’s death and ruled Syria until he was overthrown on Sunday.</p>


<p>The command declared the end of “the dark period and the beginning of a new era in Syria.”</p>


<p>State television in Iran, Assad’s main backer in the years of war in Syria, reported that “terrorists” had entered Damascus and that Assad had left the capital. It cited Qatar’s Al Jazeera news network for the information and did not elaborate.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Syrian opposition war monitor says President Bashar Assad has left the country</h3>


<p>BEIRUT - The head of a Syrian opposition war monitor says Syria’s President Bashar Assad has left the country for an undisclosed location. </p>


<p>Rami Abdurrahman tells The Associated Press that Assad took a flight from Damascus and left early Sunday. </p>


<p>Abdurrahman’s comments came after the protesters took over the Syrian capital.</p>


<p>An Associated Press journalist in Damascus reported seeing groups of armed residents along the road in the outskirts of the capital and hearing sounds of gunshots. The city’s main police headquarters appeared to be abandoned, its door left ajar with no officers outside. </p>


<p>Another AP journalist shot footage of an abandoned army checkpoint, uniforms discarded on the ground under a poster of Assad’s face.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Syrian insurgents say they have entered Damascus as residents report gunfire</h3>


<p>Syrian insurgents say they have entered Damascus, capping a stunning advance across the country, as residents of the capital reported sounds of gunfire and explosions.</p>


<p>There was no immediate official statement from the Syrian government. The pro-government Sham FM radio reported that Damascus airport was evacuated and the insurgents announced they had entered the notorious Saydnaya military prison north of the capital and “liberated our prisoners” there.</p>


<p>The night before, opposition forces had taken the central city of Homs, Syria’s third largest, as government forces abandoned it. The government denied rumors that President Bashar Assad had fled the country.</p>


<p>The loss of Homs represented a potentially crippling blow for Assad. It stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus — the Syrian leader’s base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Biden administration doesn't intend to intervene in Syria</h3>


<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s national security adviser says the Biden administration has no intention of intervening in Syria.</p>


<p>“The United States is not going to ... militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war,” Jake Sullivan said Saturday at an annual gathering of national security officials, defense companies and lawmakers in California.</p>


<p>He said the U.S. would keep acting as necessary to keep the Islamic State group — a violently anti-Western extremist group not known to be involved in the offensive but with sleeper cells in Syria’s deserts — from exploiting openings presented by the fighting.</p>


<p>Syrian President Bashar Assad’s backers — Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, "have all been weakened and distracted,” Sullivan said. He later added that “none of them are prepared to provide the kind of support to Assad that they provided in the past.”</p>


<p>The Biden administration says Syrian opposition forces’ capture of government-held cities demonstrates just how diminished those countries are by wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Syrian rebels say they have taken over key city of Homs</h3>


<p>The Syrian insurgency announced Saturday that it has taken over Homs, following reports of government forces withdrawing from the strategic city. </p>


<p>This latest development in the rebels’ swift shock offensive in the war-torn country has left embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad effectively in control of the capital Damascus and two other cities where his key support base among the Alawite Muslim population are based.</p>


<p>Homs is an important intersection between Damascus and Syria’s coastal provinces that are the Syrian leader’s base of support.</p>


<p>Syrian opposition fighters have reached the suburbs of the capital, Damascus as the rebels’ offensive picks up speed. President Bashar Assad’s whereabouts are unknown.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mother of hostage seen in video says ‘enough with the games’</h3>


<p>The mother of an Israeli man held hostage in Gaza and seen in a newly released video by Hamas says “enough with the games” and calls for more pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>


<p>Einav Zangauker told a demonstration in Tel Aviv on Saturday night that like her son Matan, “there are a few dozen who are currently alive. Don’t allow them to be brought back dead in bags. Take to the streets.”</p>


<p>Matan Zangauker, speaking under duress, appealed to the public to protest in front of Netanyahu’s home and “not let him sleep even for a minute.” Zangauker also referred to 420 days of being held by Hamas militants and said “isolation is killing us.”</p>


<p>Police used a water cannon on the demonstrators as thousands took to the streets for the weekly anti-government protests.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Iran-backed militias watch Syria events before a decision on support</h3>


<p>Two officials with Iran-backed Iraqi militias in Syria say the militias are monitoring the situation and have not made a decision to enter in support of Iran’s ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad.</p>


<p>One of the officials said Iranian militias had withdrawn to Iraq from their positions in Syria.</p>


<p>“All the militias are waiting to see what Bashar Assad will do in Damascus. If he resists and does not allow Damascus to fall, it is possible that the Iraqi factions will intervene for the purpose of support,” he said.</p>


<p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Multi-country talks on Syria end, with more to come</h3>


<p>Multi-country discussions on Syria have ended on the sidelines of the Doha Summit. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein says the countries will issue a statement, and there will be follow-up talks “taking into consideration the practical and real situation on the ground.”</p>


<p>He said the talks, which lasted over two hours Saturday evening, focused on how to stop the fighting. Eight key countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran gathered with the U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen.</p>


<p>When asked where Syrian President Bashar Assad is, Iraq's foreign minister replied, “I don’t know.” He declined to speculate on whether Assad would be overthrown. Opposition fighters have reached the Damascus suburbs.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lebanon's Health Ministry says Israeli airstrikes kill 6</h3>


<p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s Health Ministry says two Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon on Saturday killed six people and wounded five others.</p>


<p>The ministry said an airstrike on the village of Beit Leif killed five people and wounded five, while a drone strike on the village of Deir Serian killed one person.</p>


<p>Israel’s military said it was looking into the report.</p>


<p>Despite a ceasefire that went into effect on Nov. 27 to end the 14-month fighting between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah militants that had escalated into all-out war, violations of the truce have continued.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Northern Gaza hospital reports new Israeli bombardment</h3>


<p>The director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza says the facility came under heavy Israeli bombardment again on Saturday and three medical staff were killed.</p>


<p>Dr. Hussam Abu Safia in a statement posted by Gaza’s Health Ministry said the hospital was hit by over 100 projectiles and bombs, and electricity was cut off. He said the surgery department and neonatal unit were hit, and he pleaded for “immediate coordination for repair operations.”</p>


<p>Kamal Adwan is one of the last remaining hospitals in northern Gaza. Israeli forces are pressing an offensive that has almost completely sealed off the area from humanitarian aid for two months.</p>


<p>Israel’s military said it wasn’t aware of any attack Saturday.</p>


<p>The hospital director on Friday said Israeli strikes had killed at least 29 people including four medical staff.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel's military says it isn't intervening in Syria</h3>


<p>Israeli Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi says the military is monitoring the Syrian border to make sure that “local factions do not direct actions towards us,” adding that Israel is not intervening in the events in Syria.</p>


<p>Israel’s military has said it is reinforcing its deployment along the border with Syria. Halevi said if “confusion” arises and actions are directed toward Israel by “local factions” taking control of parts of Syria, Israel has a strong “offensive response.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">U.N. says it is relocating non-critical staff from Syria</h3>


<p>The United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Syria says the U.N. is relocating non-critical staff outside the country.</p>


<p>Adam Abdelmoula in a statement Saturday called it a precautionary measure to protect U.N. teams. “Let me emphasize—this is not an evacuation and our dedication to supporting the people of Syria remains unwavering,” Abdelmoula said.</p>


<p>The statement did not say how many U.N. staffers were leaving Syria as opposition fighters reached the suburbs of Syria’s capital, Damascus. The statement said the fighting in Syria has displaced over 370,000 people as the humanitarian situation deteriorates, “with many seeking refuge in the northeast and others trapped in frontline areas, unable to escape.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Foreign ministers gather at Doha Summit to discuss Syria</h3>


<p>Foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran have gathered on the sidelines of the Doha Summit along with the U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, to discuss the situation in Syria.</p>


<p>The talks continued late Saturday and no details were immediately available. Qatar, Jordan and Iraq also were part of the discussions as opposition fighters closed in on the Syrian capital, Damascus.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">About 2,000 Syrian soldiers cross into Iraq, official says</h3>


<p>BAGHDAD — An Iraqi government spokesperson says about 2,000 Syrian army soldiers have crossed into Iraq seeking refuge as opposition forces advance in Syria.</p>


<p>Bassem al-Awadi said the soldiers’ equipment and weapons were registered and taken into custody by the Iraqi army. “We dealt with them according to the principle of good neighborliness and humanity,” he said Saturday.</p>


<p>Al-Awadi also said Iraqi officials are concerned about the security of the al-Hol camp and other facilities in northeast Syria where suspected Islamic State group members and their families are detained. The facilities are guarded by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.</p>


<p>Al-Awadi said there is “high security coordination” between Iraqi officials and those forces to “prevent the prisoners from escaping.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Syria's army fortifies positions in Damascus suburbs</h3>


<p>Syria's army says it is fortifying its positions in the suburbs of Damascus and in the country’s south, as opposition fighters close in on the capital.</p>


<p>The army statement on Saturday also asserted that Syria is being subjected to a “terrorist” and propaganda campaign aiming to destabilize and spread chaos.</p>


<p>The statement also said the military is continuing with operations in areas including the central provinces of Hama and Homs, and that it has killed and wounded hundreds of opposition fighters.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2 wounded in car-ramming attack in the West Bank</h3>


<p>At least two people were wounded in a car-ramming attack in the West Bank on Saturday, according to the Israeli army and rescue services.</p>


<p>The army said the attack took place in the area of the Fawwar refugee camp, near the city of Hebron. It said a soldier was severely wounded, and security forces were looking for the attacker. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service said another man in his 40s suffered light injuries from shrapnel.</p>


<p>The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza sparked the war there. Israel has intensified its military raids in the West Bank, targeting what it says are militants planning attacks, and there has also been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel's military assists U.N. forces against attack in Syria</h3>


<p>The Israeli military says it is helping United Nations forces to head off an attack on a U.N. position in Syria close to the Israeli border.</p>


<p>The army said in a statement Saturday that an attack was carried out by “armed individuals” on a U.N. post near the Syrian town of Hader and it was “assisting U.N. forces in repelling the attack.”</p>


<p>On Friday, Israel’s military said it would reinforce its forces in the Golan Heights and near the border with Syria, where civil war has reignited between the government and opposition fighters.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hamas releases a video of an Israeli hostage</h3>


<p>Hamas has released a video showing Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker making an emotional plea for his release and describing the conditions he and other hostages face in Gaza after being seized in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.</p>


<p>His mother, Einav, has become a symbol of the fight to bring back the hostages and is an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.</p>


<p>Matan Zangauker, speaking under duress, appealed to the public to protest in front of Netanyahu’s home and “not let him sleep even for a minute.”</p>


<p>Zangauker also referred to 420 days of being held by Hamas militants. “We want to return before we go crazy. Isolation is killing us, and the darkness here is frightening,” he said, describing having little food and medicine and “undrinkable” water.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trump says on Syria that ‘this is not our fight’</h3>


<p>President-elect Donald Trump has made his first extensive comments on dramatic advances by opposition fighters in Syria, saying the besieged President Bashar Assad didn’t deserve U.S. support to stay in power. “THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,” Trump posted on the Truth Social platform on Saturday.</p>


<p>Syrian opposition activists and regional officials have been watching closely for any indication from both the Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration of how the U.S. would handle the sudden advances against Syria’s Russian- and Iranian-allied leader.</p>


<p>Trump condemned the overall U.S. handling of the 13-year civil war in Syria, but spoke favorably of the routing of Assad and Russian forces.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Turkey says attacks on civilians in Syria were the straw that broke the camel's back</h3>


<p>ISTANBUL — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday that there was “now a new reality in Syria” following the rapid advance of rebel forces.</p>


<p>Speaking in Gaziantep, a city less than 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Syrian border, Erdogan said that “increasing attacks on civilians” in Syria’s northwest Idlib province “triggered the latest events like the straw that broke the camel’s back.”</p>


<p>It was not possible for Turkey to ignore developments in a country with which it shares a lengthy border and it would not allow any threats to its national security, he added in a televised speech.</p>


<p>“Our wish is for our neighbor Syria to attain the peace and tranquility it has been longing for for 13 years,” he told a rally of supporters. “We want to see a Syria where different identities live side by side in peace. We hope to see such a Syria in the very near future.”</p>


<p>Erdogan claimed President Bashar Assad had erred in rebuffing Turkey’s previous efforts to establish relations, saying Damascus “could not appreciate the value of the hand Turkey extended.”</p>


<p>Ankara has supported anti-Assad rebel groups since the early months of the conflict and hosts 3 million refugees dislodged by the fighting. While Turkey lists HTS, the group leading the latest offensive, as a terrorist organization, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army has worked alongside it.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tension in Damascus as security forces patrol the streets</h3>


<p>BEIRUT — A resident of the Syrian capital of Damascus says the city is very tense as troops and members of security agencies are deployed on main streets and intersections.</p>


<p>The resident told The Associated Press that many shops are closed and those that are open have run out of main commodities such as sugar. He added that if food products are available, some shops are selling them for a price three times higher than usual.</p>


<p>“The situation is very strange. We are not used to that,” the resident said on condition of anonymity, fearing retributions. “People are worried whether there will be a battle (in Damascus) or not.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Russian foreign minister refuses to make predictions about Syria</h3>


<p>DOHA, Qatar — Russia’s foreign minister says he has met his Turkish and Iranian counterparts in Doha and that all three countries were calling for an “immediate end to hostile activities” in Syria.</p>


<p>Russia and Iran are the chief supporters of Syria’s government, while Turkey backs opposition fighters trying to remove President Bashar Assad from power.</p>


<p>Speaking at the annual Doha Forum, Sergey Lavrov said Russia continues to help the Syrian army confront insurgents, military via airstrikes. Asked whether Assad’s rule is threatened by the fast-moving rebel offensive, he said, “We are not in the business of guessing what’s gong to happen.”</p>


<p>He blamed the United States and the West for the events in Syria and said, “We are very sorry for the Syrian people who became a subject of another geopolitical experiment.</p>


<p>“We are doing everything we can not to make terrorists prevail, even if they say they are not terrorists,” Lavrov said, referring to the de facto leader of the Syrian insurgents, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who says he has cut links with al-Qaida. His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and United Nations.</p>


<p>He said Russia, Iran and Turkey want the full implementation of a U.N. resolution, which endorsed a road map to peace in Syria. Resolution 2254 was adopted unanimously in December 2015. </p>


<p>The measure called for a Syrian-led political process, starting with the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections.</p>


<p>Lavrov also downplayed reports that Moscow had withdrawn ships from Russia’s base in Syrian city of Tartus, saying that the vessels had left to take part in naval exercises in the Mediterranean.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">US envoy says Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire offers opportunity for Lebanon</h3>


<p>DOHA, Qatar — The U.S. envoy who brokered the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah says the deal has created a new opportunity for Lebanon to reshape itself.</p>


<p>Amos Hochstein told the Doha Forum that the weakness of Hezbollah after nearly 14 months of fighting along, along with blows to its Syrian and Iranian allies, give the Lebanese military and government a chance to reassert itself.</p>


<p>“Now is the moment with this ceasefire to rebuild Lebanon again for a much more prosperous future and stronger state institutions,” Hochstein told The Associated Press on the sidelines of the conference.</p>


<p>He said Lebanon needs “to do its part” by rebuilding its economy, choosing a president after years of delays and strengthening its central government to attract investors.</p>


<p>“And the international community has a requirement and a responsibility to support Lebanon after this devastating conflict and after years of Hezbollah control,” he said.</p>


<p>Hochstein told the conference that the turning point in ceasefire efforts was Hezbollah dropping its pledge to keep fighting as long as the war in Gaza continues. He said the change in position was the result of the heavy losses inflicted on Hezbollah, and Lebanese public opinion in favor of delinking the two conflicts.</p>


<p>He said key tests for the ceasefire will be whether Israel carries out its promised phased withdrawal from southern Lebanon over the coming two months and whether the Lebanese army is able to move into those areas.</p>
