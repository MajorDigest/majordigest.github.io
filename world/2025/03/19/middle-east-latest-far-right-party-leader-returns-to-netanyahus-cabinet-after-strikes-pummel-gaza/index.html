<p>The Israeli military is retaking control of a key corridor that cuts off northern Gaza from the south, Israel's military said, deepening its renewed offensive in Gaza. Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas on Tuesday in a wave of heavy strikes that have continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity.</p>


<p>More than 400 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday, nearly two-thirds of them women and children, making it the deadliest day in Gaza after 17 months of war, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry's records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. </p>


<p>Israel's defense minister warned Wednesday that attacks on Gaza would increase “with an intensity that you have not known” until Hamas frees dozens of hostages and gives up control of the territory. Hamas has yet to respond militarily, but Israel's actions threaten to drag the sides back into all-out war.</p>


<p>Here's the latest:</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UN peacekeepers observe 7 Israeli activities in south Lebanon violating UN resolution</h3>


<p>United Nations peacekeepers have observed seven Israeli activities in southern Lebanon violating a U.N. resolution.</p>


<p>U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the activities took place north of the U.N.-drawn boundary between Israel and Lebanon. The 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution requires Israeli forces to remain south of the boundary known as the Blue Line.</p>


<p>The peacekeeping force, known as UNIFIL, reiterated its call for a complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon so the Lebanese army can deploy throughout the area, Haq said.</p>


<p>In another incident, Haq said, UNIFIL peacekeepers found rocket launchers, rocket-propelled grenade and other unauthorized weapons and ammunition caches in seven different locations in south Lebanon. The discoveries were all reported to the Lebanese Army for their action, he said.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UN peacekeeper in south Lebanon wounded after stepping on a mine</h3>


<p>U.N. peacekeeper in southern Lebanon has been wounded after stepping on a mine.</p>


<p>U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said the incident took place during “operational activity” by the peacekeeping mission known as UNIFIL in the village of Zibqin.</p>


<p>The wounded peacekeeper was initially treated at a nearby UNIFIL facility and transferred to a hospital in Beirut where his condition is stable, Haq said, adding that his injuries are not life-threatening.</p>


<p>He said the “terrible incident” highlights the dangers of unexploded ordnance and told reporters UNIFIL has increasing demining activities.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weeks after returning home, Palestinians evacuate a town in northern Gaza</h3>


<p>Palestinians in a war-ravaged town in northern Gaza are leaving by foot, in vehicles and on horse-drawn carts after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate.</p>


<p>Associated Press journalists saw people packing up Wednesday and carrying their belongings from Beit Hanoun to nearby Jabaliya.</p>


<p>Cars were piled high with people’s clothes, mattresses, plastic barrels and whatever else they could carry. A Palestinian boy perched on top of one cart grinned and raised his hands in the v-for-victory sign with two fingers.</p>


<p>The fresh wave of evacuations were reminiscent of the displacement experienced by hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled northern Gaza for the south earlier in the war. Many had returned to their hometown during the ceasefire but are being forced out now that Israel has resumed its military campaign.</p>


<p>Israel Katz, the Israeli defense minister, said the Wednesday that the military would soon order Palestinians to evacuate from combat zones.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Echoing Trump, Israel’s Netanyahu slams ‘deep state’ efforts to undermine him</h3>


<p>In a nod to his ally U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said their two administrations stand strong together against the “deep state.”</p>


<p>“In America and in Israel, when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people’s will,” Netanyahu wrote Wednesday on the social platform X, using his English-language account. “They won’t win in either place!”</p>


<p>Netanyahu faces fierce public criticism over his recent move to fire the head of the country’s domestic security agency as well as attempts by his government to dismiss the attorney general. He often accuses state institutions like the police and the judiciary of being out to get him.</p>


<p>He’s striking a similar chord to Trump, who rails against the “weaponization” of the Justice Department and others in the federal government against whom he has grievances. It’s also rare for Netanyahu to use his English-language account on X to criticize domestic political opponents or the state institutions he says are against him.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel offers condolences for the UN employee killed in Gaza but insists it didn't kill him</h3>


<p>Israel’s Foreign Ministry has expressed sorrow over the death of a United Nations worker in Gaza, but said an initial probe found the Israeli military was not responsible.</p>


<p>The circumstances of the episode were being examined, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said in a statement.</p>


<p>The Israeli military earlier also denied involvement in the death, which occurred after ordnance hit a U.N. guesthouse in the city of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to the U.N.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Surgeon in Gaza offers details on wounded UN staff </h3>


<p>Dr. Osama Hamed, a Jordanian surgeon volunteering at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Gaza, said at least three U.N. staffers were brought to his hospital Wednesday morning, including one he spoke to directly.</p>


<p>A U.N. staffer arrived with a “massive destructive injury to his leg,” Hamed said, and the orthopedic surgeons ended up amputating it below the knee. The hospital was already juggling multiple other wounded Palestinians who had arrived before the U.N. staffers, he said.</p>


<p>Another U.N. staffer with a severe brain injury was taken to the Gaza European hospital, Hamed said. His condition was not immediately known.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israel is still launching strikes across Gaza </h3>


<p>An Israeli airstrike in far northern Gaza killed at least 17 people and wounded at least 30 others, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.</p>


<p>The strike Wednesday evening hit a condolence gathering in the Salateen area of Beit Lahiya, so most of the dead were from the same family, according to Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry’s emergency service in northern Gaza. </p>


<p>The dead include at least two children aged 11 and 16, and a 65-year-old man was killed along with two of his sons, Awad told The Associated Press.</p>


<p>Another airstrike earlier Wednesday killed at least five people in the southernmost city of Rafah, Palestinian first responders said. </p>


<p>The strike hit a vehicle in the Musbah area on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Civil Defense agency, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The casualties were taken to Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis, which confirmed the deaths.</p>


<p>Israel's military said the strike in Rafah targeted two Hamas militants and that its forces were “continuing extensive strikes throughout the Gaza Strip.”</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Yemen's Houthis say more airstrikes pound the capital</h3>


<p>Strikes hit Sanaa, Yemen’s rebel-held capital, as well as their stronghold of Saada in the country’s northwest on Wednesday night, the Houthi’s al-Maisrah satellite news channel reported. </p>


<p>At least seven women and two children were injured Wednesday in a U.S. airstrike in the Thurah district in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, said Anees al-Asbahi, a spokesman for the Houthi-run Health Ministry. The strike hit an under-construction public event hall, setting fire in the facility, he said, adding that many neighboring houses were damaged.</p>


<p>The Houthi news channel also said strikes happened overnight Tuesday, though the U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of places targeted since the airstrike campaign began. The first strikes this weekend killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trump warns Yemen’s Houthis ‘will be completely annihilated’</h3>


<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday stepped up his rhetoric regarding Yemen’s Houthi rebels as the American military launched more airstrikes against the group, warning they “will be completely be annihilated.”</p>


<p>Trump made the comment on his website Truth Social. He claimed, without offering evidence, Iranian military support to the rebels “has lessened” but said it needed to entirely stop.</p>


<p>“Let the Houthis fight it out themselves,” he wrote. “Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians, and watch how it will get progressively worse — It’s not even a fair fight, and never will be. They will be completely annihilated!”</p>


<p>The Houthis said strikes against them continued overnight. The U.S. military has not offered a breakdown of the strikes.</p>


<p>Despite more than a year of U.S. strikes and naval patrols, experts say commercial shipping will likely continue to stay out of the region because of the Houthi threat.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UN chief is ‘deeply saddened and shocked’ by staff member killed in Gaza</h3>


<p>Without naming Israel, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the deadly strike on a U.N. guesthouse in Gaza and called for an investigation.</p>


<p>Israel denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. But there have been no reports of rocket attacks by Hamas since Israel broke the ceasefire on Tuesday.</p>


<p>“The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them,” Guterres said in a statement via U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq.</p>


<p>The U.N. has not yet said which country the international staff member working in Gaza was from.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Syrian government and Kurdish officials discuss merging their armed forces</h3>


<p>The new Syrian government wants to bring Syria’s breakaway Kurdish militias back under government control, but the details of their recent breakthrough agreement are still being worked out and negotiators will have overcome a decade of civil war.</p>


<p>Government officials met Wednesday in the northeastern province of Hassakeh with the commander of the main Kurdish-led group in the country, the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is backed by the U.S.</p>


<p>The meeting comes a week after Syria’s interim government signed a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country’s northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the SDF into the Syrian army.</p>


<p>The deal should be implemented by the end of the year. It would bring northeast Syria’s borders and lucrative oil fields under the central government’s control.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Witnesses describe strikes on a UN building in Gaza</h3>


<p>Palestinians living close to a U.N. building in Gaza that was hit by a deadly strike on Wednesday say the facility had been struck multiple times by tank shelling in recent days.</p>


<p>Naief al-Lahham said the building was hit by tank shelling Tuesday evening, but it didn’t result in casualties.</p>


<p>On Wednesday morning, he heard two explosions minutes apart, he told the AP, adding that the attack came from an Israeli position just east of the building. A U.N. staffer was killed and at least five others wounded.</p>


<p>The explosion shook al-Lahham’s house, damaging its windows. He said he was lightly injured by pieces of glass.</p>


<p>The U.N. says it had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility’s location. Israel denies targeting the U.N. compound.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hamas says Israel has fully backed out of the ceasefire deal by retaking Gaza corridor</h3>


<p>A spokesman for Hamas said Israel’s closure of the main north-south route in Gaza, the Salahuddin road, is part of Israel’s “blockade on Gaza.” </p>


<p>“The Zionist occupation, under American cover and international silence, is destroying life in Gaza and reneging on the signed agreement,” Abdel-Latif al-Qanou said in a statement Wednesday.</p>


<p>Israel has closed all Gaza’s border crossings since the beginning of the month and banned the entry of food and other supplies. There had been a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the ceasefire.</p>


<p>Al-Qanoua said Hamas is willing to engage with any proposal leading to starting negotiations on implementing the ceasefire's second phase.</p>


<p>He said the only person who benefits from resuming the war is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while it “threatens the life of the hostages in Gaza."</p>


<p>Both Israel and the United States blame the renewed hostilities on Hamas’ refusal to release more hostages before negotiations on ending the war proceed — which was not part of the ceasefire agreement.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Israeli military says it launched a 'limited ground operation to retake part of a key Gaza corridor</h3>


<p>As part of the ceasefire, Israel had withdrawn from the Netzarim corridor, which it had used as a military zone and which bisected northern Gaza from the south.</p>


<p>The move appeared to deepen the renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza, which shattered the two-month-long ceasefire with Hamas.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israeli defense minister says evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza combat zones will start again soon</h3>


<p>In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Israel was preparing to step up its new offensive.</p>


<p>Katz said that if the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are not freed, “Israel will act with an intensity that you have not seen.”</p>


<p>Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remained of their homes and Israeli forces had pulled back to a buffer zone during the ceasefire in Gaza, which began in late January.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lebanese army deploys in northeast border town after dayslong clashes</h3>


<p>The clashes along the Lebanon-Syria border, where smuggling is widespread, was the worst fighting there since the fall of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government in December.</p>


<p>The fighting happened after Syria’s interim government accused militants from Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group of crossing into Syria on Saturday, abducting and killing three soldiers. Hezbollah denied involvement and some other reports pointed to local clans in the border region that are not directly affiliated with Hezbollah but have been involved in cross-border smuggling. The Lebanese government said the three Syrians killed were smugglers.</p>


<p>The Lebanese Health Ministry said seven people in Lebanon were killed in the fighting, and 52 others were wounded. Four Syrian journalists embedded with the Syrian army were lightly wounded after an artillery shell fired from the Lebanese side of the border hit their position.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">UN says an international staffer was killed and at least 5 others wounded by a strike in the Gaza Strip</h3>


<p>An international United Nations staffer was killed and at least five others were wounded in a strike on a U.N. guesthouse in the Gaza Strip, a U.N. official said Wednesday.</p>


<p>Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the U.N. Office for Project Services, declined to say who carried out the strike but said the explosive ordnance was “dropped or fired” and the blast was not accidental or related to demining activity. UNOPS operates the mechanism tracking aid trucks into Gaza, does demining and helps bring fuel in.</p>


<p>He did not provide the nationalities of those killed and wounded.</p>


<p>The Israeli military, which has carried out a heavy wave of airstrikes since early Tuesday, denied earlier reports that it had targeted the U.N. compound. There have been no reports of rocket fire or other Palestinian militant attacks.</p>


<p>Moreira da Silva said strikes had hit near the compound on Monday and struck it directly on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, when the staffer was killed. He said the agency had contacted the Israeli military after the first strike and confirmed that the military was aware of the facility’s location.</p>


<p>“Israel knew this was a U.N. premise, that people were living, staying and working there,” he said.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">At least 436 dead in airstrikes, Gaza Health Ministry says </h3>


<p>The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 436 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel launched a wave of heavy airstrikes early Tuesday.</p>


<p>The ministry said another 678 people have been wounded in the strikes, which continued into Wednesday but at a lower intensity.</p>


<p>The Israeli military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.</p>


<p>The ministry said at least 183 children and 94 women have been killed since the strikes began early Tuesday. Its records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Israeli military denies striking UN compound in Gaza </h3>


<p>The Israeli military has denied striking a United Nations compound in central Gaza.</p>


<p>Gaza’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike on a U.N. building in Gaza on Wednesday wounded five international staffers.</p>


<p>There was no immediate comment from U.N. officials.</p>


<p>“Contrary to reports, the (Israeli military) did not strike a U.N. compound” in the central city of Deir al-Balah, the army said in a statement.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Macron calls Israeli strikes in Gaza ‘tragic step backwards’</h3>


<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel’s airstrikes are “tragic step backwards” for the Palestinian people and for Gaza, and for Israeli hostages and their families.</p>


<p>Macron, speaking alongside Jordan’s King Abdullah II on a visit to France, called for an immediate end to hostilities and resumption of negotiations including with the U.S. administration toward a permanent ceasefire and the release of all hostages.</p>


<p>The two leaders were also expected to discuss the need to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and restoring access to water and electricity in the Palestinian territory, Macron’s office said.</p>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Malaysia will accept 15 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons</h3>


<p>Malaysia said it will accept 15 Palestinians who were released from Israeli jails and exiled as part of the January ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.</p>


<p>Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said in remarks published Wednesday in The Star newspaper that the move was a small contribution from Malaysia, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, to ensure peace in Gaza.</p>


<p>Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told local media that security agencies would strictly monitor the Palestinians’ movement once they arrive.</p>
