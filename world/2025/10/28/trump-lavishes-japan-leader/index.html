<p><strong>🌸 IN JAPAN</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trump’s new bestie:</strong></h3>







<p><strong>President Trump</strong> met with new Japanese Prime Minister <strong>Sanae Takaichi</strong> on Tuesday, just days after she took office.</p>



<p>It was a lovefest all around. Trump lavished her with praise, telling Takaichi, “Anything I can do to help Japan, we will be there. We are an ally at the strongest level.”</p>



<p>The feeling must have been mutual. White House press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> says Takaichi will nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a goal for Trump. Japan also gifted 250 cherry trees to the U.S. and 📹 Takaichi gave Trump a golf club that belonged to the late Japanese Prime Minister <strong>Shinzo Abe</strong>. (Abe memorably presented Trump a gold-plated driver in 2016.)</p>



<p>Trump then went into campaign rally mode, speaking to U.S. service members aboard the USS George Washington, which is docked at a Navy base outside Tokyo. He touted the military as no longer being “politically correct” and ramped up his threats against blue cities in the U.S., adding a threat that “more than the National Guard” is needed.</p>



<p>The president even urged U.S. troops in Japan to purchase cars made by Toyota. (#ad? #sponsored?)</p>

<p><strong>🌀 HAPPENING NOW</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hurricane Melissa is about to make landfall:</strong></h3>



<p>Hurricane Melissa is nearing landfall in Jamaica as a catastrophic Category 5 storm.</p>



<p>It’s maximum winds have reached 185 miles per hour. It’s only 5 mph short of breaking the record as the most intense hurricane in the Atlantic, per The New York Times.</p>



<p>The National Hurricane Center posted a final warning for Jamaica. “THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE!”</p>

<p><strong>📹</strong><a href="https://x.com/BNODesk/status/1983185052675813831"><strong>Treasure Beach, Jamaica, this morning</strong></a></p>



<p><strong>💳 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not exactly a fun record to break:</strong></h3>



<p>It’s Day 28 of the government shutdown and Congress is on track to break the record for the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Senate Chaplain <strong>Barry Black</strong> reminded Congress this week about a lack of bragging rights associated with the record.</p>



<p>“Lord, remind our lawmakers that <strong>no gold medals are given for breaking shutdown records</strong>, but a crown of righteousness is given to those who take care of the lost,” Black said. 📹 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7pcpauk1s"><strong>Watch the clip</strong></a></p>



<p>The effects of the shutdown are getting dire. Federal food assistance benefits won’t be paid in November. The program could tap into reserve funds to keep the program afloat, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture decided not to do that as a strategy to ramp up pressure on lawmakers.</p>



<p>The Hill’s <strong>Alexander Bolton</strong> reports that senators are feeling an increased sense of urgency to end the shutdown. Alarm is setting in over food assistance drying up, flight delays and no paychecks for federal workers.</p>



<p><strong>Read Bolton’s reporting: </strong><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5575450-federal-workers-call-end-shutdown/"><strong>‘GOP, Democrats face rising pressure on multiple fronts to end shutdown’</strong></a></p>



<p><strong>Vice President Vance</strong> is on Capitol Hill today, joining Senate Republicans’ weekly luncheon.</p>



<p><strong>Senators are looking to ease some of the shutdown pain</strong>:</p>



<p>Sen. <strong>Ron Johnson </strong>(R-Wis.) has offered a proposal to pay all federal workers while the shutdown continues. He told The Hill that his proposal will be discussed at today’s weekly luncheon. Senate GOP Leader <strong>John Thune</strong> (S.D.) says there’s “strong support” among Republicans for this.</p>



<p>Sen. <strong>Josh Hawley </strong>(R-Mo.) said on Monday that Republicans can’t allow the ObamaCare subsidies to simply expire at the end of the year. So far, 10 Republican senators have co-sponsored Hawley’s food assistance funding bill.</p>

<p><strong>📰 THE TALK OF DC</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>We have to talk about the KJP situation:</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve been on any social media platform in the past day or live in Washington, you’ve heard about <strong>Isaac Chotiner</strong>’s interview with former White House press secretary <strong>Karine Jean-Pierre </strong>as part of her book tour.</p>



<p>The interview is wild. So wild that one journalist almost missed their metro stop this morning while reading it. (It wasn’t me.)</p>



<p>Jean-Pierre tangled with Chotiner about her grievances with the Democratic Party. Essentially, she says she left the Democratic Party and became an independent because Democrats, in her view, were so mean to her former boss, former <strong>President Biden</strong>.</p>



<p>At one point, Chotiner even told Jean-Pierre: “I’m not sure what you’re saying.”</p>



<p><strong>Excerpt — Chotiner</strong>: “You feel like you had to leave the Democratic Party because of the way it treated Joe Biden. How did it treat Joe Biden?”</p>



<p><strong>Jean-Pierre</strong>: “I call it a betrayal. … And I was watching what Democratic leadership was doing. It was an all-out, full-on campaign to embarrass him, to push him out. And I just thought to myself, Wow, you don’t have that much time left this election year. And I thought to myself, This man is one of the most decent people that I know. And objectively, objectively, it was a good Presidency.”</p>



<p><strong>Read The New Yorker interview: </strong><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-bidens-white-house-press-secretary-is-leaving-the-democratic-party"><strong>‘Why Biden’s White House Press Secretary Is Leaving the Democratic Party’</strong></a></p>



<p>It doesn’t end there. The Washington Post published a devastating review of Jean-Pierre’s new book.</p>



<p><strong>Yikes, this excerpt</strong>: “It is incredible — and emblematic of the Democrats’ total aesthetic and intellectual driftlessness — that someone who writes in such feel-good, thought-repelling clichés was hired to communicate with the nation from its highest podium.”</p>
